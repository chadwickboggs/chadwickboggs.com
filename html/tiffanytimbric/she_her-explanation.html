    <h2><i>She/Her Pronouns</i></h2>
    <blockquote>
      I, Tiffany Timbric, am a transgender woman.  I was assigned male at birth
      but as my identity developed it's gender was female.  I changed my legal
      name from "Chadwick K. Boggs."
      <p>
      I strive for sincerity in all things.  I believe most aspects of me,
      including my gender identity, were biologically predetermined.
      Intellectually I think and emotionally I feel that pursuing beauty, harmony,
      and truth should define me.  I strive to be that in all ways and
      always with "grit" for great end results.
      <p>
      I grow when connecting with people.  I hope you and I may connect
      someday and together build the most wonderful things possible as it may
      be that what we build comes from what we are.
      <p>
      Joy!!&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;)
