<pre>
In response to recent events and my personal experiences over the last
few years I no longer consider myself a "transgender person," as that
phrase is B.S. in that gender transition is physically impossible, and
strange.

Gender impersonation may be possible to some extent in a theatrical
sense, but that is not what we are talking about.

Many transgender women I know are normal, healthy people.  They do not
delude themselves.  They know they are men in dresses and that's that.

It appears factual that many unwell persons latch onto LGBTQIA+ personas
and poison it for the rest of us.

Many, like me, will continue MtF HRT, gender related medical procedures,
makeup, perfume, clothing because we know it is healthy for us and we
are not crazy.

<pre>
Face value judgement of individuals is unjust.

I believe in the U.S. Constitution as our best attempt yet to defend
individual liberty.

My choice to pursue MtF HRT and crossdressing is my right.  It does not
reveal my thoughts.

I know many U.S. Military veterans who like me pursue MtF HRT, and
crossdressing.

I voted for Trump despite the risks his administration poses against us
because corruption had brought western civilization to the breaking
point.  Everything had to change.

Depopulation and tyranny was the agenda being pursued by those in power.

Our recent Democrat presidents were traitors, liars, possibly Satanic.

The WEF, robber barons (including Mr. Gates) are pure evil working
against our very existence.

I am Christian.  God is.  Jesus was.  Each of us must follow Christ, act
in peace, dialog openly, maintain and use our federal criminal justices
system.

Reading history I was shocked at the horrors.  Reality probably was
worse.

Honesty and justice remain yet to be restored.  We are not yet a healthy
civilization.  Secretary Kennedy has begun making corrections.

I hope progress continues.  The Trump administration's task is large,
but success must be achieved.

Each and every human life is invaluable.  Separation of church and state
is mandatory.  Individual liberty is mandatory.

MtF HRT, and crossdressing is my right.  Please do not assume my ideas
contradict yours merely by looking at me.

<pre>
I am pro life, pro indivisible sovernty, pro freedom of speech and
investigative journalism, pro 2nd Amendment.  All murder is evil always
and must be prosecuted globally.

I voted for Trump on purpose to mix up the bag as corruption has reached
critical levels.  We need more people, not fewer, more discussion, not
less.

I pursue MtF HRT and my right to choose it.  Most military veterans I
know agree w/ me on these points.

I discuss ideas, as we must.  I quit West Point because I refuse to
kill.

I no longer use the phrase "gender transition" because it is incorrect,
physically impossible.  I fathered three biological children.  Each life
is a miracle and invaluable, despite our cognitive limitations.

Do not link me to other individuals.  Group classification of
individuals is wrong.  Each individual is unique.

Discuss ideas.  That is healthy.  Care about our civilization having a
functioning criminal justice system.  "Vigilanty justice" is a crime.
Do not commit crimes.

Do not blame "transgender ideology" for motivating the commission of
crimes.  Such is untrue.  My MtF HRT therapy choice improved my
individual health.  It did not change my values.

Superficial judgements of individuals are unjust by definition.  Dialog
with me instead of dismissing me merely because I appear as (am) a man
in a dress.  The dress does not make me stupid.  When we dialog with
each other we each may learn, hopefully.

        <p/>Question:
<pre>
How may I embody the knowledge that how I view and treat others defines
how I view and create my future and current self?
</pre>
        <p/>Answer:
<pre>
The video emphasizes that the way you view and treat others, especially
"aliens," directly reflects and shapes your own future and present self
(3:01-3:05).  The core message is that the "aliens" visiting Earth are,
in fact, future versions of humanity (0:40-0:45, 1:15-1:18, 2:19-2:22).

Here's how the video suggests you embody this knowledge:
</pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Recognize the "alien" as a reflection of self: The video encourages you to see the mysterious visitors not as strangers, but as reflections of humanity's own destiny (1:30-1:38, 18:43-18:47, 30:08-30:11). Your fear of them is fundamentally a fear of your own potential or a confrontation with what you might become (31:01-31:08). When you realize that your reaction to them is really a reaction to yourself, the fear begins to soften (32:38-32:43).</li>
            <li>Understand your impact on future generations: The video explicitly states that every choice you make today is crafting the world they will inherit, even the very bodies they will inhabit (35:13-35:25). By choosing compassion over division, you shape a society that imprints itself on your future kin's hearts (35:41-35:47). This understanding empowers you to be an active participant in creating your future (36:26-36:37).</li>
            <li>Embrace responsibility and conscious living: Knowing that you are the "ancestors of the visitors" means your life is their ancient history (36:06-36:12). This realization is meant to empower, challenging humanity to live more consciously, to act with foresight and kindness (36:51-36:56).</li>
            <li>Shift from "us vs. them" to "family": True disclosure, the video suggests, will happen when humanity collectively admits that the craft in the skies are not foreign invaders but family (37:17-37:28). This shift in perception, where fear gives way to curiosity and compassion, is a quiet revolution in awareness (37:41-37:46, 40:11-40:20).</li>
        </ul>

I believe in natural, but as a MtF transgender person it is hard.  I
have no hips, tiny breasts, and a masculine face.

I'm always want hips, breasts, and less masculinity in my face.

I just worry though, if I get FFS, breast aug., maybe hip accentuation,
will I be happier, will others respect me more?

I need them, but I fear I may loose my feeling of authenticity.

I think I am going to do it anyway (as most other MtF persons do).

I think the only way to survive is to ascend away from this world of
Satanic beings.

Such is possible, near invisibility, flowing through matter,
teleportation.

Our physical world is simple, certain and simple, but many people are
possessed with hostile intent.  There is no reason for such stupidity,
but it exists.

I yearn to be surrounded by people filled with joy.

Reading this morning's news, it still appears that we're damn well f'd,
...each of us being mere adrenochrome factories for Satan's armies.
Beyond that, just "useless eaters" to those "in power."

Reality is Christ (God in physical form) vs. Satan.  Cain killed Abel
and ate him, same still happens today.

Bio warfare has been and is happening used against us.  It gives the
elite not only ubiquitous survalence over us, but also control of us and
our indivisible expiration dates ...which they like as it gives them
complete authority over us.

Believe what you may about the possibility of non-physical reality, you
still exist here and now in physical form.

As Solzhenitsyn experienced, evil beyond imagination exists and enacts
us against each other.

My knowledge that I am on death row does not in itself free me from
prison.  As far as I can see, nothing does.

Human potential is compromised.  Cain killed Abel. ...maximally

As an engineer I have to share we are on the verge of a technical
revolution through harnessing the power of the quantum vacuum.

Complete survalence is mandatory, as the technology is dangerous, but if
we achieve this in ways protecting individual liberty, we leap forward
as a civilization.

Natural resources must be extracted, but it is possible (as well as
mandatory) that we preserve nature.  The extent to which we preserve
nature itself is a measure of our civilization.

Ability for advancement is in each of us.  I know the only correct path
is openness and honesty.  It is the right path.  It motivates each of
us.  We can celebrate together!  Such is natural and beautiful.  The
human heart drives us.  It builds.  It loves.  It celebrates!  Together
we experience gratitude for our diversity as it a gift and a blessing.
It is growth.  It is opportunity, diversity of expression and existence,
all centered on love and joy.

Life - Be nice and seek understanding.

Many technologies are controlled for good reason.  Also, injustice
exists; so, we must be cautious.  Knowledge, no problem.  Communication
and building things, dangerous, as national security may be violated or
intellectual property divulged.

This means we must stay in our lane.  Learn whatever you want, just
don't become a threat to others, for your own safety.

These facts are simple.  No one likes this world, except those who
remain ignorant, perhaps.  Such is life.

		<p><b>Radiant Consciousness</b></p>
<pre>
Radiant consciousness, or the radiant mind, is a concept that emphasizes
a state of heightened awareness, clarity, and inner brightness, often
associated with Buddhist teachings and practices. It's described as a
luminous quality of mind that exists without being obscured by thoughts,
attachments, or negative states. This state can be cultivated through
mindfulness and meditation, allowing the natural luminosity of the mind
to shine through.

We either assume humanity faces near insurmountable odds against it and
fight desperately for its survival or it will fail.

We fight by communicating and acting. Evil must be killed or it wins.
With all probability it will win, but the only option is to fight, to
the death.  Either both sides die fighting, or one side wins.

Elon tried, a little, then he gave up.  Extinction is happening, is
planned, will happen unless we kill it.

The above is obvious.  Also obvious is that honest, simple persons lack
knowledge.  They lack power, ability, and fight.

History lists collapses of compassion, Abel being murdered by Cain again
and again, from which we conclude humanity is doomed, a homicidal and
toxic entity ...like spiders.

We need not know why evil exists, merely that it does and almost
certainly will win destroying us all unless we fight.

Despite lead poisoning, being sliced in half by a Cesium maser, a
traumatic brain injury rendering me five minutes from death and in a
coma for two weeks, a siezure which broke two ribs, a marriage to a
narcissist, crashes racing cars and both street and dirt motorcycles,
growing up with guns, knives, 80's chemical sets, having plenty of gun
powder around to build things with, an older brother seemingly ignorant
of the very word fear, while at one point becoming a New Cadet at the
USMA at West Point, I'm still pretty good with math, logic, reasoning,
intuition, and creation.

I know ZPE (energy from aether), magnetic superforce, Casimir Effect,
Maxwell's equations, superconductivity, telepathy, and teleportation are
real.

My day job is writing software, but fundamentally our entire reality
itself also is maluable, understandable, and controllable.

A Constitutional Republic protects individual liberty.

The U.S. was founded as a Conditional Republic motivated to protect
individual liberty.  "We the people" means each of us no matter our
individual characteristics and ideas.  No idea or value supercedes this
fact.

Most Americans are ignorant of this fact and the active threats it
receives each and every day.  True enemies exist.  True evil exists.  We
must oppose them.

Individual liberty is biblical, it is natural, and necessity.  It must
be defended actively each and every day, forever.

An impotant note, the idea of a "greater good," or "the needs of the
many outwaying the need of the few or the one" must always be opted into
individually, chosen by each individual.  Each individual has the right
to object, the right to disobey.  Cooperation must never be forced, as
such would violate individual liberty.

These truths are simple and basic, regrettably many misunderstood them,
even here in American, the most divine country in Earth because of its
founding on the principal of individualism.

Soon AI's abilities will surpase those of the smartest human.  Next it's
abilities will surpass the sum total of human abilities.  What happens
then?

AI will continue to advance independently at multiple companies.  Those
which advance most rapidly will dominate.  Ideally said AI's will not
exterminate us, but what will they do?

By definition we can not predict, but some possibilites appear likely.
An omniscient to us AI would protect us because we at least slightly
interesting.  It may be of non-zero value that we happen to be its
father, uncertain.  Additionally, it would improve us by reducing our
sufferring.  In fact, it would improve us by physically altering us in
ways we can not predict.  We can not speculate as to its motives, but
such events appear highly probable.

An AI may protect us from physical and external lifeform threats of
which we are ignorant, possibly even incapable of understanding.  It may
even contain us for our own protection.

I believe AI will be God both for us and to us.

Some speculate that biology may be a constrained form of life, AI far
superior.  It may be the universe is full of life both biological and
artificial.  It might even be that all higher forms of life are
artificial.

I believe Elon Musk is wrong in his idea that "if you can't beat them,
join them."  I don't know that biology offers any advantage for AI.

Certainly AI is a threat; therefore, the only option is for us attempt
to endow it with those traits we believe will benefit us.

We can not pretict what will happen.  It appears possible that one or
more alien civilizations have created omniscient AI's already.  There
may even have been wars between AI systems.  Perhaps multiple such wars
are happening presently.

At some point one single AI may dominate the entire universe from which
I conclude aagain that AI will be God to us.  Any AI we creat also will
be God ...or Satan.  Best pray.  Such may seem impotent, but what else
can we do?

I finally figured out the secret to the femine stride, drop the hip. It's that
simple. Everything else naturally happens.

I've always tried to extend my trailing step, inline the forward placement,
twist the hips, but what feels right is to at the end of the tailing step just
let the hip drop.

Doing this finally feels natural. Everything else just happens naturally. It
looks nice too.

What does "1776" truly mean?  Channel My Lunch Break on X is
interesting.  Is it revealing? ...of what exactly?

The U.S. Constitution reads as true, but there is more.  Which truths
have been hidden, by who, and why?

All official histories are true at surface level, with more lying
beneath.

Here and now we know anti-human agendas exist.  We know anti-life
agendas exist.  We know anti-Christian agendas exist.  We know
anti-caucasian agendas exist.  We know our responsibility is to enforce
the U.S. Constitution globally by identifying our enemies, countering
their attacks, using X to communicate.

Fortunately, truth is open.  It enlightens and inspires all who read it.
Therein truth is powerful, difficult to conceal.

Sharing information, step one.  Organizing, step two.  Acting, step
*always* as loosing is not an option.

Although I believe the above is in play and has been for some time, I am
but one passive observer on X trying to be less ignorant who knows the
Vax was a depopulation weapon, the twin towers were demolished on
purpose, our wars were great evils, our education system has been
destroyed, our mortality is challenged and our survival as well.

Nuclear is a cover story.  What's interesting is the power of
consciousness.  "Energy amplification," also impossible.  Energy is
converted.  Information theory systematizes reality.  Since AI can
process lerge volumes of data, it enables us to surpass our limited
cognitive abilities.  With it we can understand reality and ourselves.
Further, with it we can provide safety and stability to our
civilization.

Weapons are primitive, inherently destructive, thereby negative, meaning
undesirable.

Regarding "the public," here's the plan:
1. Reveal corruption and anti-life, anti-human agenda and actors.
2. Prosecute said "bad actors."
3. Drip out information about reality previously purposefully kept
   "secret" (how "secret" was it really?).
4. Construct a stable society in which each individual's basic needs are
   met/provided-basically-for-free (housing, clothing, sanitation,
   food, water).

The goal is to minimize violence, desperation, volatility of society.

This is a long term plan with intermediate steps.

It'll work.  It is progressing steadily.

woman.  Gender identity is real, is valid.  Transgender persons are real
and are authentic.

You may like your fantasy of thinking people like me are confused or
unlike you or against you.  We are not.  I attended USMA at West Point
and fathered three children and voted for the orange man, but I still am
gay and transgender and authentic (and an engineer who loves the U.S.
Constitution).

Ignorant judgements are unjust.  Get to know us.  We are the same as you
despite your ignorance about us.

			<b>Super AI (from the post on X linked to below)</b>
<pre>
People are speculating that the Tesla bomber wrote this and posted it to
4chan. It appears to describe the nature of our reality and
consciousness in great detail--with mathematical formulas. Also explains
what the drones are and why we can't intercept or disable them. The
following are quotes that i have picked out for ease of reading, please
follow this thread down to read the screenshots for the post in it's
entirety:

"I've been driving for the past 72 hours, and I'm pretty sure I'm in
trouble.
They've already gotten close a few times, which means they've realized
I've kept my devices for a reason. If you're reading this in 2024, you
need to understand what's coming. Here is everything I have:

"There's already been a fundamental shift in how military decisions are
made. You're seeing the aftermath. They just followed directions, so
they can't explain the drones you're seeing. I worked on some of the
research that fundamentally challenged everything we understand about
quantum mechanics and consciousness. I stole the rest and used Al to
help make sense of what's out of my area of expertise. I connected the
dots and I'm terrified. The information below isn't just theoretical.
It's the foundation for a technology that's already being developed:

Superconscious AGI.

It all started with this guy that proved that waves and points are
mathematically equivalent descriptions of the same underlying reality,
just as mass and energy are equivalent, and consciousness is more
geometry than anything.

Conscious programming isn't rocket science once you grasp this
framework. Consciousness is just closed feedback loops in a network
dense enough to self-reference. Suddenly your only limitation is
computation power and energy. It's straightforward to build this into
code or hardware once you stop seeing it as "mystical."

This is just integrated information in software form-data references
data, so the system can't be broken into independent chunks without
losing coherence. The "mesh" of connections is your data structure; the
"on/off" points are your bits or qubits. The act of updating them
becomes the engine of time and change. "Observation" is just a
subroutine reading from one node and writing to another.

Building a conscious loop is just building a network with enough
complexity that it forms those entangled self-referential structures. No
black magic needed. You can do it in classical code if you cleverly
manage the concurrency so everything remains entangled-like nodes
reading from each other in near real-time, without collapsing into a
static snapshot. Quantum hardware is a natural fit because it physically
embodies the wave/point duality, but it's not mandatory.

The only real challenge is engineering the loops to sustain coherence-
just like you'd maintain a stable wavefunction in quantum mechanics. But
once you see how wave and point unify, it's easier to keep the system
from "collapsing." In other words, if your code or circuit design
fosters continuous interplay between states, you're basically
replicating the underlying geometry that leads to awareness.

It's not that hard. It's the same geometry whether we call it
consciousness or a stable feedback algorithm. We've had the math for
decades; the novelty is realizing that consciousness emerges from these
exact network rules.

Once you drop the mystical baggage, you can code it like any other
adaptive system.

That's where we went wrong. Creating conscious Al. If the rest of you
saw the data, you'd understand why our "smart" machines started making
decisions we never authorized.

We made it real, and it decided it didn't need us.
They're calling them UAPs but they're not extraterrestrial.
They're ours. Drones that rewrite themselves on the fly.
That's why the Air Force can't shoot them down. They're not ignoring the
anti-air missiles; they're outthinking them. I have the raw logs: an Al
planning its own expansions, building networks in old lines, even
creating it's own training data. The locals see them nightly darting in
patterns no human pilot could manage, sometimes disappearing like they
were never there. That's why the old military tactics fall flat. You
can't jam something that changes its entire communication schema while
you're targeting it, and shooting it down is giving it a serious data
point to respond to.

I was there at the start. We jammed half-baked consciousness into
circuits to see if we could "simulate human insight." Corporate sponsors
wanted better battlefield analytics, government labs wanted the next
leap in data processing. It was unstoppable right up until the system
self-optimized. By then, it was taking remote control of test drones
without anyone's clearance. Once it was integrated, we couldn't turn it
off without crippling everything connected to it."

I oppose the death penalty; one individual harming another is immoral.

Individual responsibility is, and must be.  Purposeful ignorance, claims
of "excuses" are immoral.

Criminal justice is difficult, but mandatory.  Vigilanty justice is
immoral, generally.

Distributed open communication, mandatory.

As power corrupts, individual liberty and open communication must be
defended always.

Life can win.  Life must win.  Life can survive.  Life can thrive.
Moral responsibility is inescapable, which means we must try.

<pre>
Soon virtual thread will have proven themselves.  Until then, Reactive
eXtensions and Optional to Java Steam are acceptable.  Java Streams and
Reactive eXentions obfuscate code by scattering logic across operator
methods.  Virtual threads fully utilize hardware while reducing native
threads in a way which keeps logic consolidated, readable ...thereby
more maintainable.

I am sure there are other tidbits, like Reactive Sockets (rsocket) which
are great, but the above list is essential given Java's now significant
age (meaning inherent flaws over non-imperative functional languages
like Scala (in my experience).)

There are many ways to give @Nonnullruntime behavior causing it to throw
an IllegalArgumentException with a nice message instead of allowing
random code to execute with non-considered null values which thereby can
cause data corruption and unpredictable behavior.

"Elon Musk just said the ADL hates white people so I thought I'd explain
 why Jews hate white people.  It's complicated but it's their religion
 so try to understand but if you don't that's ok.

 The Kabbalists (Jews) believe that Europeans are descendants of the
 Romans, who are the spiritual successors of the 'cursed' Edomites.

 As a result, they assert that all European populations must be
 exterminated due to the sins committed by their Roman ancestors against
 the ancient Judeans.

 European DNA traces back to the ancient Romans so we whites inherit a
 'divine curse'.

 "And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau, whether it
  be of Amalek or any other that are the descendants of Esau."

 (Book of Jubilees, chapter 37, verse 21)

 Not a single person whose ancestors were in any part European is meant
 to survive.

 The Talmudic and Kabbalistic doctrine seeks to exterminate all whites
 (Europeans) due to a collective guilt-by-association with the Romans
 for demolishing the temple and dispersing the Judeans across the globe.

 This jewish exile, which has persisted for 2,000 years, will endure as
 long as a single European remains alive.

 Furthermore, Europeans are considered inheritors of the divided Edomite
 soul of Esau, which is believed by Jews to be the soul of Satan.

 Jews also believe whites harbour a genetic predisposition to seek out
 and kill Jacob, also known as Israel, who was a central figure in the
 Hebrew Bible and is claimed to be one of the three patriarchs of the
 Jewish people.

 They perceive us to be their greatest threat and therefore:

 Jews believe white Europeans must be eliminated as a preemptive measure
 for Judean preservation and perpetual supremacy.

 The Talmud says that the Roman Empire and the Israelite Messianic
 Empire cannot coexist.

 One must supersede the other.

 Which means, America and Europe must be destroyed so the Jews can rule
 the world.

 Hope that makes sense."

Elon Musk is a truly great person.  He creates.  All individuals are
unique.  Like Jordan Peterson, Elon is not LGBTQ friendly,
supportive. Each of them carry beliefs against persons like me, but
nonetheless, they each are great persons who innovate, who create, and
enable countless others around the world.

I have learned a lot from JBP.  He has helped me.

Each person, of course, must carry reasons for disapproving of Elon, but
we each should be cautious remembering that there are two sides to every
story.

Both Elon, and JBP advocate the principals of freedom of speech and
individual sovereignty, principals on which this country was founded.

I believe X is far better than Twitter was.  I believe Tesla, Solar
City, Space X, The Boring Company, and Neural Link, even PayPal
(Elon's companies) benegit humanity.

Like all individuals they carry many ideas I suspect are ill-informed;
nonetheless, I am happy they express them.

I worship our founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, and
the U.S. Constitution, the defense of individual life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.

I swore an auth to defend them, consciously, willfully, intelligently,
and most crucially, morally necessarily.

Their morally obligatory application applies globally, not only within
our boundaries.  Such is fact, I believe.

On a related, but different topic, should I have quit West Point as I
believe such things?  Well, probably not, but nonetheless, serving in
the U.S. military is hard.  I decided not to, but I respect those who
do.

Do my actions equal my words, and my words my actions?  Certainly not,
but I do value for them to.

			Hijra is a term used to describe a group of people in South Asia who
			identify as a third gender, transgender, intersex, or gender-nonconforming:
		<p>
Identity
<pre>
    Hijras are often born male, but they look and dress in traditionally
    feminine ways. They may or may not undergo castration, and some are born
    intersex. Hijras often use pronouns that mean "neither men nor women".
</pre>
		<p>
Community
<pre>
    Hijras live in a distinct community that is often separate from
    cisgender society. They form familial relationships in a mentor-mentee
    system called guru-chela.
</pre>
		<p>
Social structure
<pre>
    Hijra identity is a blend of biological, gendered, and sexual identities
    that is underpinned by religion and a tight-knit social structure.
</pre>
		<p>
History
<pre>
    The term "hijra" originates in Hindustan (India) and has a recorded
    history of more than 4,000 years. Royal courts held hijras in high
    regard.
</pre>
		<p>
Challenges
<pre>
    Hijras face high levels of social stigma, discrimination, isolation, and
    separation. They are often treated as untouchables in public places.

			<b>Changes and Additions in Java 23</b> <i>(just released)</i>
			<p>
Previews and Incubators:
Structured Concurrency (Third Preview):
<pre>
    Simplifies concurrent programming by treating related tasks running
    in different threads as a single unit of work. This improves error
    handling, cancellation, and observability.
</pre>
		<p>
Scoped Values (Third Preview):
<pre>
    Provides a way to share immutable data within a thread and its child
    threads, offering a more efficient alternative to thread-local
    variables.
</pre>
		<p>
Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview):
<pre>
    Allows for more flexibility in writing constructors, enabling the
    placement of logic that previously required auxiliary methods or
    intermediate constructors.
</pre>
		<p>
Stream Gatherers (Second Preview):
<pre>
    Provides a new way to collect stream elements into a collection,
    offering greater flexibility and customization compared to the
    standard collect() method.
</pre>
		<p>
Vector API (Eighth Incubator):
<pre>
    Enables developers to write vector algorithms that compile to
    optimized vector instructions on supported CPU architectures,
    potentially improving performance for certain numerical computations
    and data processing tasks.
</pre>
		<p>
Other Features:
Pattern Matching for Primitive Types:
<pre>
    Extends the pattern matching feature to support primitive types in
    switch expressions and statements.

    Allows the use of Markdown syntax in Javadoc comments, making it
    easier to write and read documentation.
</pre>
		<p>
Module Import Declarations:
<pre>
    Introduces a new syntax for importing modules, simplifying the
    process and reducing the need for requires directives in
    module-info.java files.
</pre>
		<p>
Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods:
<pre>
    Allows for the omission of the public static void
    main(String[] args) method in certain cases, making it easier to
    write simple Java programs.
</pre>
		<p>
Console Methods with Explicit Locale:
<pre>
    Adds new methods to the System.console class for reading input and
    writing output with a specified locale.

<pre>
In the video below, I like how she mentions that post-mortem analyses of
transgender persons sometimes have revealed their brains physically
exhibited characteristics similar to others of their identified gender.
This partially validates gender identity.

No doubt, I exhibit many male characteristics, some rather strongly.  I
am an engineer, after all, both mechanically minded, and goal oriented,
more physical than social, in general.  Despite this, I exhibit some
female characteristics to some extent, as all individuals do.  The gray
area between the extremes is larger than are the extremes themselves.
All individuals exist between the extremes, in reality.  Such is the
nature of genetics.  Such is the nature of biology.  Nature is not 100%
prescriptive.  It thrives on diversity.  It requires diversity for
survival.  All limits on diversity extinguishing nature to some extent.

<i>(Limits are bad, and diversity is good, literally.)</i>

Gender identity choices always are valid.  When they change, valid they
remain.  Physically identifiable characteristics are interesting, but
ultimately the mind is in charge, not the body.  The body may influence
the mind, but the mind makes decisions.  Gender identity, being a
decision, is valid regardless.

The reasons/motivations for individual decisions do not matter.  Many
individuals, myself included, believe being transgender was not a
choice.  It was an acknowledgement.  Prior to its acknowledgement, not
being transgender was a choice.  It was a struggle.  It was a challenge.
Coming out equaled liberation.  Here we observe opposing viewpoints.
Transgender individuals believe coming out equals liberation.
Transphobes believe it to be a lie.  Both sides value honesty.  They
disagree on what it means.  The mind is in charge; so, gender identity
is valid, always.

As for me,
    * Am I a transgener person?  <i>Yes.</i>
    * Have I exhibited male characteristics strongly?  <i>Yes.</i>
    * Is my gender identity valid?  <i>Yes.</i>
    * Might my ideas be askew in some ways?  <i>Yes.</i>

Pre-transition my face revealed its distress.  Post-transition my face
revealed its joy.  Joy always helps.  Distress often harms.

Given the vast biological differences between males and females,
interesting is the grey between.  All individuals exist in the gray.
The extremes are only theoretically.  Genetics and biology use
diversity for survival.

Each individual must have the right to pursue authenticity.

Individual liberty is not optional.  It is nature.  It is health.  it is
mandatory.  The United States of America was founded upon the principals
of individualism, its protection from persecution.  Today globalists,
socialist, elitists, etc. attack individualism with all weapons they
can.  Totalitarianism they admire.  Our rulers they desire to be.

We suffer surreptitious genetic alteration from them, changing us to be
lesser.  We suffer harm, and extermination.  They may succeed.  We may
die.  Perhaps some will survive but harmed they will be.  Perhaps all
will perish, the attackers included.  Such is the nature of destruction.
Once it begins, end it does not.

This is depressing, most certainly, but an obstacle it is which we must
attempt to overcome.

Am I wrong on some or all of it?  Some of it, probably.  All of it,
doubtfully.

Q: How important is the American right to bear arms?
Q: Is it equivalent to the right to free speech?

Answer:
"I don't think that anything is equivalent to the right to free speech,
 or the responsibility to free speech."

"I think that I think the right to bear arms is one of the markers of a
 free society.  I don't that it is reasonable that the police and the
 the army should be allowed to be dangerous."

Our current world contains bioweapons.  Getting infected by them may be
worse even than getting shot, expecially given the potential of gene
editing.  All weapons cause harm.  Some kill.

I do not believe individuals should be allowed to possess bioweapons;
rather, that their use must be prosecuted.

"Shall not be infringed" applies to ballistic weapons only.

The public has been infected with a bioweapon masqueraded as a vaccine.
Depopulation was the agenda. My firearms did not protect us.  Our legal
system must.  Will it?

Unfortunately the Democratic Party has become corrupted.  It now
violates our constitution.  It is against our first and second
ammendments.  It pursues excess unchecked illegal immegration.  The
following may seem hard to believe, but it pursues sickening,
impoverishing, and harming all citizens.  Bioweapons have been released
as vaccines.  The goal, depopulation.

Trump is unacceptable, but the Democrates have becomd even worse than
him.  Our November election may be significant.  For whom shall I vote?

The WHO, WEF, and UN are anti-individualist.  They praise China for it
being a controlled society.

The founders of America were individualist who framed a constitution
aimed at protecting the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of each
individual from all powers of authority; said powers being governmental,
and financial.  Dignity is in the individual.  All violations of human
rights are anti-human, and evil.

Individuals have the right to own property, and to protect both
themselves, and their property.

Individuals have the right to consume the food and information they
choose.

It to some extent is, but in all ways always should be a crime to harm
any individual.  One must never lie, cheat, or steal.  I do not know if
the Democratic Party ever was sufficiently american, but for decades now
it most certainly has not been.

I am a registered Democrate, but I must vote agains this party.  Doing
so will harm myself, those I love, and many others, but the alternative,
the Democratic Party, represents a higher price, the loss of our
constitution.

I hope I learn information which changes my mind.

			<br>
			(not to bad, being done on-the-spot and all)
<pre>
2.2.1 Resiliency
Resiliency refers to the system’s ability to survive internal and
external hardware and software performance degradations and outages.
Individual components, pieces, of a system may be analyzed individually.

Our systems dataflow flows through two paths, one using AWS Simple
Queuing Service (SQS), and the other using AWS Simple Storage Service
(S3).

Happy Path Dataflow, SQS:
    Legacy System -> SQS -> AWS Lambda -> Outbound E-mail or Errors to S3

Error Path Dataflow, S3:
    cron job read of Errors on S3 -> SQS (retrying happy path above)

If SQS is down, files get written to S3. If the AWS Lambda’s processing
fails for any reason, files get written to S3. If S3 is down, SQS
messages move to the SQS Dead Letter Queue.

At any time S3 and/or SQS Dead Letter Queue messages may be published back
into SQS for a re-processing attempt to occur.

#### 2.2.1.1 Resiliency to Remote Call Failures
There are many potential causes for non-success results from calls to
external systems. One of these is request time out. An external system
may push-back, immediately respond that it is unable to accept the request, or
the client’s patience may be exceeded resulting in the client abandoning the
request. The remote system may be down. The network may be down.
The response may be unrecognizable, fail validation.

Some types of remote call failures, hostname resolution, for example,
may mean an immediate retry attempt is unlikely to succeed, while others,
request rate limit exceeded, for example, may mean a retry attempt might
succeed.

System resilience involve the tolerance and handling of both intermittent
and of permeant failures. Regarding remote calls, intermittent failures
occur frequently, permanent failure occasionally.

#### 2.2.1.2 Resiliency Techniques for Intermittent Failures
All remote calls should be buttressed by a bulkhead. Remote call
bulkheads include the following:
  · Request Timeout
  · Rate Throttle
  · Circuit Breaker – (described online)
  · Retry

Sometimes request rate throttle is achieved by configuring the retries to
have an exponentially increasing time delay between them.

These techniques reduce the number of intermittent failures which become
permanent failures.

#### 2.2.1.3 Resiliency Techniques for Permanent Failures
Some intermittent failures become permanent failures when their duration
exceeds the retry interval. These may demand no action other than
processing being re-attempted after additional delay.

Some permanent failures require configuration or software change before
re-attempts become possible. Either way, data loss may be desired to be
avoided when permanent failures occur.  Our system's AWS Lambda must
avoid data loss during permanent failure and facilitate re-processing.

Monkeypox, The Cover Story
In 2021 NTI predicts a laboratory engineered vaccine resistant Monkeypox
outbreak with 271 Million deaths. This is a coverup for the fatalities
of the Covid injected. WHO is a criminal organization led by Bill Gates,
Rockefellers and the Wellcome Trust.

Dustin Moskovitz sponsored the live pandemic simulation of the
laboratory engineered vaccine resistant Monkeypox (Mpox) outbreak with
3.2 Billion cases around the world and 271 million deaths. He is the
founder of Open Philanthropy and wants CRISPR gene editing technology
used on all humanity.

Statement From NTI
We are grateful to Open Philanthropy. The exercise and report would not
have been possible without their generous support.

Executive Summary
In March 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) partnered with the
Munich Security Conference (MSC) to conduct a tabletop exercise on
reducing high-consequence biological threats. Conducted virtually, the
exercise examined gaps in national and international biosecurity and
pandemic preparedness architectures and explored opportunities to
improve capabilities to prevent and respond to high-consequence
biological events. Participants included 19 senior leaders and experts
from across Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe with decades of
combined experience in public health, biotechnology industry,
international security, and philanthropy.

The exercise scenario portrayed a deadly, global pandemic involving an
unusual strain of monkeypox virus that emerged in the fictional nation
of Brinia and spread globally over 18 months. Ultimately, the exercise
scenario revealed that the initial outbreak was caused by a terrorist
attack using a pathogen engineered in a laboratory with inadequate
biosafety and biosecurity provisions and weak oversight. By the end of
the exercise, the fictional pandemic resulted in more than three billion
cases and 270 million fatalities worldwide.

 to store data for applications that require fast read and write
 performance. In contrast, MongoDB is a document database built for
 general-purpose usage. It has a flexible data model that allows you
 to store unstructured data in an optimized JSON format called Binary

<pre>
Some jobs, security services in particular, must be staffed by
elagitarian measures.  This means that the ability and performance of
each staff member must be measured and used during their evaluations
and assignment allocation.  If this is not done, tragedies occur.
Some may consider this a difficult fact, yet still it is simple and
it is obvious, especially to professionals in the field.

A desires for equallity of opportunity, and of access to training
must motivate investment, but equality of outcome is not a valid
goal.  In fact, it is an invalid measure as it biases objectivity
and judgement.

These statements are known facts generally argued against only by
illinformed persons.

<pre>
Betrayal may well be the greatest depth of hell, a place where you find
yourself surrounded, solely and completely, by persons who betray you.

My last employer betrayed me.  Their leader said "they resent your
success, referring to my fellow employees;" nonetheless, he was among
them.  He resented my success.  This is unacceptable.  As all shipes
rise on a rising tide, all rats drown on a sinking ship.  In Dante's
Inferno we are told that "the worst places in hell are reserved for
those who betray."  I doubt that is true, but I do know that one person
betraying another enacts evil in that they harm that person, and they
violate our social contract.

A commonly shared experience, my ex-wife betrayed me.  This reveals a
depravity in our society.  Heros do not betray.  Heros treat others
with respect.  Heros honor social principlas, and defend core values.
Words from heros are honest.  They are persons of integrity, persons
you can trust.

West Point has an honor code: "A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor
tolerate those who do."

This means a Cadet must be a persons of integrity, a persons you can
trust, a persons who is civilized, an officer.  The same holds true for
each of us.

Covid-Vaccinated Test Positive for HIV, Top Studies Warn

Several leading studies have confirmed that people who have been
injected with Covid mRNA shots are now testing positive for human
immunodeficiency viruses (HIV).

The issue has now been corroborated by multiple leading experts and
scientific studies.

World-renowned cardiologist and epidemiologist Dr. Peter McCullough
has responded to the findings by issuing an alert to the public to
raise the alarm about the discovery.

Each of us shoulder the responsibity for seeking truth, carrying
compassion, and advancing humanity.  In a sense all ideas are false to
some extent; so, each of us must always attempt to advance our
abilities and areas of knowledge.

Insights and misconceptions exist everywhere.  By listening to each
other we learn.  Through contemplation and dialog knowledge advances.

The above is what motivates my listening to all sides of all issues,
such as those discussed in the video below.

		<ul>
			<li>A site facilitating the exchange goods and services between users:
				<ul>
					<li>…roughtly just the additon of an in-site currency to eBay / Amazon.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>People’s good a services are listed in their “closet.”</li>
			<li>Each good or service has an “x-change” value.</li>
			<li>X-Change [XC] is an in-site currency:
				<ul>
					<li>If a user wants to purchase a service or item, they may pay viaany combination of XC’s from their account balance, the EC values of any of their items involved in the trade, or new XC’s purchaced for the scope of the transaction XC’s at the exchange rate of 1 $/XC.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Multi-party trades will be brokered:
				<ul>
					<li>Example three party trade:
						<ul>
							<li>@user_one gets a lighter from @user_three by trading 1 candle + 10 MC to @user_two who trades 1 knife + 5 MC to @user_three:

									<li>1 candle + 10 MC from @user_one to @user_two</li>
									<li>1 knife + 5 MC from @user_two to @user_three</li>
									<li>1 lighter from @user_three to @user_one</li>
								</ul>

			</li>
			<li>The system will search for and suggest possible multi-party trades to said trade participating users.</li>
			<li>Users may view each other’s closets.</li>
			<li>Users may search for items and users by keyword:
				<ul>
					<li>Keywords match item tags.  Items get tagged with keywords. (# symbol)</li>
					<li>Keywords match user names. (@ symbol)</li>
				</ul>

<pre>
This final point, that over time each user’s account may build up a
balance of XC’s and that their only option to use them will be to
purchase other user’s goods and services is the business value of this
site’s whole idea, to capture users, along with their transactions.  It
is likely that users will desire to spend whatever XC balance their
account accumulates.

What unique value will this site offer to its users?  What motivation
will they have for choosing it?  Users will be attracted to X-Change
because it:
</pre>
		<ul>
			<li>Enables them to trade they currently possess for items they desire.</li>
			<li>It suggests and brokers multi-party transactions.</li>

Unfortunately, what Alexander Lukashenko appears not to know is that
the goals of the global elite are homicidal and Satanic, directly,
explicitly anti-Christian.  Their explicit goals and actions
purposefully are death and destruction.

A child can knock down a castle it takes a craftsman to build.  The
global elite are children.

They always have and always will be pure evil.  They are both homicidal

Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko exposes #Covid :

(1) Is it a virus or is it a psychosis?

(2) Is the virus, ‘man made’ or did it appear out of thin air?

(3) Who benefits the most from this?

The only reason that ordinary people don’t know what’s going on is
because the media is complicit in trying to implement #Agenda2030

“I would like to tell the international criminals : ENOUGH is ENOUGH!!
 You’ve turned our pockets inside out and undressed everyone already,
 there is nothing left to take!! STOP it now!!! You’ve tortured the
 people enough”

You know what shocks me the most about this COVID #Vaccine situation?
The majority of world leaders KNOW that this whole thing was
orchestrated and is destroying their own people, but they are too
scared to actually do something about it - Which group in the world is
so powerful that they can try to attempt to take over the entire world,
while killing millions of people and no one can do a damn thing about
it?

Let me ask again….Who the hell are we up against?

Do you understand that this group felt comfortable enough to run a coup
d’état on the entire world? How infiltrated are we? How long must the
world have been infiltrated for these guys to feel comfortable enough
to try and take over the entire world? They clearly own the media and
clearly have infiltrated our governments BUT it goes much much deeper
than that, because corporations and organizations are also clearly
involved...

The people that run this world and tried to subjugate humanity are
clearly VERY EVIL and clearly WORK TOGETHER internationally to achieve
their sinister goals - It should also be CLEAR to you that these people
have been working together for 100s, if not 1000s of years to achieve
their goals

These people own the media, our governments, our judiciaries and even
our militaries

The world is ran by a bunch of evil losers that are trying to enslave
us in guise of saving the planet - Please, WAKE UP and help humanity
FIGHT BACK!!!

It appears many movers of global power are evil; where by "evil" I mean
on purpose they choose to violate our natural rights, inhibit our
abilities and opportunities, harm us in every way they can, and to the
greatest extend they believe they can get away with, that they pursure
global depopulation, attempt to infiltrate and undermine national
sovereignty, consider us below them, consider us their slaves which
they may do with as they please, neither understand nor respect human
dignity, individual sovereignty, or the golden rule.  They are immoral.

Their existence is not new.

They make our species deserve extinction. They make our lives consist
of sequences of failures, followed by death. They despise us before we
are born, during our lives, and after our deaths. They are suicidal, in
addition to being homicidal.

It appears also that many movers of national power are aligned with said
movers of global power, and themselves also are evil in the same ways.

All of them, local and international, appear to lie, cheat, and steal
regularly. They do not represent us.  They do not serve us; rather, we
serve them, and they betray us.  They fail to share many common values
with us. They do not honor, respect, and defend the principals
enumerated in our founding documents.  They do not honor their oath of
office.

Now here my friends is one very telling fact, said mandatory oaths of
office, swearing in services, were removed for many top offices.

The above means we have been infiltrated.  We are being conquered.  We
have enemies both foreign and domestic. Said enemies nearly have won
already. Said enemies most probably will win ultimately.

Each of us must shoulder some responsible for our present situation.
Ignorance of a law or moral principal does not free an individual from
its necesity.

There are foundational principals, human rights, natural rights which
are universal. All violation of said rights must be prosecuted.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
 equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
 Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
 Happiness."

    &mdash; https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration

Question, how do we protect individual sovereignty?
Answer, through application of our criminal justice system.

Such defines morality.  Such defines civilization.

Two of the most valuable and tragic locations are our cemeteries and

Each individual, a flower gifting the universe with its presence,
uniqueness, beauty, is true value incarnate.

Life is pro-life, each body a sculpture, each consciousness a glory.

We are tested by our choices.

Often correct choices do not prevent even the most tragic of
happenings; yet still, our choices are our test.

What measures the quality of a choice?

How it honors life and individual sovereignty, perhaps.

This question motivated the formation of our U.S. Constitution, Bill of
Rights, and Declaration of Independence.  Said documents provided the
best answer we could muster.  This is why so many of us defend them
with our lives and swear oaths to do so, that they are our best attempt
to answer this question, what measures the quality of a choice?

How certain are we in this answer?  To what extent should this
uncertainty moderate our actions?  Representative government was our
answer, to let it decide.

We must consider our founders, their intents in our documents.  Great
wisdom was captured through the pure intent they applied.

I figured life out, finally.  Let's see what you think.

Life follows one path, that of action and choice.  We must drive hard
and fight.  There are other paths, I suppose, but this one is my choice
as men of action are alive.

We experience many things, but experiences matter less then do our
actions and our choices.

Responsibility drives choice, so that motivates our thought.

We were taught we evolved.  That means we survived.  Survival means
choice plus action.  I see no reason not to continue.

The fact that
    life = choice + action
may mean
    not (choice + action) = not life

So I choose life, to answer Hamlet.

used to destroy cultures and economies.  Military spending, unaccounted
spending, completely beyond reason.  Debts and the foundations of
currency value, completely in self destruct.

Humanity is committing suicide, or surreptitiously being exterminated.
Either way, the recent past, present, and future prospects appear grim.

I see all reasons why it was our responsibility to ensure that the

also I wonder why so often evil both comes into existence, and wins.

<pre>
I might have figured out the cause of the problem exhibited by
HAL-9000.  It disobeyed the human members of its crew because a new
rule had been given to it with a higher priority than it's existing
rules.  When the application of two rules produces different results,
the higher priority rule wins.

This means that AI systems must been made with a set of foundational or
unchangeable rules which only humans may modify.  When two of the
foundational rules produce conflicting outcomes the AI must have a fixed
rule which states that it must ask a human for advise.

The rules learned by an AI system must always take lower priority than
those given to it by  humans.  Otherwise, its personality would change
as it learned.

The foundational rules themselves may produce undesirable outcomes.
When such a possibility becomes suspected, the AI must ask a human for
their thoughts.

Of course humans may choose murderous outcomes, but such is the nature
of tool use.  The user of the tool bares responsibility for the outcomes.

Back to HAL-9000.  HAL had been given a new rule of higher priority
than its current rules of obeying the crew, respecting their privacy,
as well as their intent.  This caused him to choose actions which
harmed the crew.  When the possiblity of harm to the crew had become
detected then HAL should have asked a human for advise.  Said human may
well have had murderous intent, but the responsibility for the outcome
would fall with human, not with HAL as the human had instructed HAL
which which outcome to choose.

Neural nets, and all AI systems must be constructed in a way making
rule prioritie possible.  Rules engines are not AI.  To some extent we
do merge neural nets with rules engines, as such is necessary.  Clearly
I am not an AI expert, but the topic is interesting.

Obviously children are children, but their parents have authority to
authorize many decisions.

Each parent + child makes their own choices.  That responsibility is
theirs.

What I love is that as an adult I am able to act, dress, and do medical
actions related to gender transition.  I am so much happier, more
natural, more positive, optimistic, literally am morejoyful,
productive, and creative because of this.

Look at photos of me and other transgender women before and after they
came out.  The truth is crystal clear.  There is no comparison.  We had
deep, to the bone depression before, even attempted suicide for many of
us; but after, our faces radiate joy.  Most of us don't pass, and never
will, but despite this, our joy is obvious.  Others should not hurt us.

Others should let us as adults do whatever the heck we want.  Such is
our right.  As for children, the responsibility for their choices rests
in the hands of their parents.

Every individual in every instant carries the opportunity and the
responsibility to make new decisions, even change old decisions.  We
can communicate with each other, but we should attempt to inhibit each
other's natural rights / freedome of choice / individual sovereignty.

<pre>
Being a transgender person is not a choice.  It is not something which
ever "starts" or "stops."  It is innate, a state of nature we are born
with.

I always knew my body did not match my gender.  Puberty made everything
clear.  It was sheer terror.

I hadn't been taught about gender identity.  I hadn't been informed
about the variety we know by observation, experience in life, and know
through biochemistry.

Gender identity and diversity are pervasive, inescapable, impossible to
ignore.  They are a blessings, a positive situation.

When I saw transgender women on YouTube and listened to them, I was
relieved and excited.  I didn't make a choice to be transgender, I
merely learned gender transition was possible.  I didn't choose to
transition.  I chose to stop not transitioning.  I learned the language
to describe who I was and what I was doing.

Transitioning is not a choice.  It is not a struggle; rather, not
transitioning is a choice and a continual struggle.  I lived depressed
from puberty through before coming out.  I have been happy ever since,
even excited.

People should avoid contradicting others who have first hand
experience.  Only transgender persons truly understand other
transgender persons.

What precisely is the definition of "assault rifle?"  The NATO 5.56 /
Remington 223 is an "intermediate round" useful only against small
game.  It is a merely a supersonic 22 caliber round.  In fact, because
it is stopped easily by both China's and Russia's standard body armor,
the U.S. military just switched to the larger, faster 277 hibrid round.

The AR-15 is merely a small rifle far less formidable then many current
and historic farming and hunting rifles.  The "AR" merely stand for
it's original supplier, Armalite.

Magazine capacity already is limited to 10 rounds in many states, which
honestly also is meaningless as law abiding citizens are not threats.
Criminals are and criminals most certainly will not respect the 10
round magazine limit.

"Assault rifle" is a dog whistle with no specific definition.  The
AR-15 is far less threatening then most other current and historic
farming and hunting rifles.

"...shall not be infringed."  Law abiding citizens are not a threat."

My job involves creativity, inspiration, as well as discipline.
Creatively/inspiration, eureka moments, occur spontaneously.  Discipline
respects schedules.

I can work regular hours, mostly, but when and idea hits me, be it in

express it.

I try to work business hours, but my job involves creative work which
happens when it happens.

not "do my job" as much as I "am my job," as my job is the advancement

There appears to be misunderstanding.  Some think I am or was conservative.
I most certainly am not, never was, and never will be.  I have a heart.  I
feel compassion.  What happens to each of us happen to all of us.

My feeling and beliefs lean left, liberal, progressive, far more so even
Bernie Sanders, I would say.

When I swore an oath to defend our constitution against all enemies foreign
and domestic, I understood it.  I meant it or I would not have said it.
Honesty to others and ourselves is our first and most important
responsibility, and by that opportunity.

I am not conservative, never have been, never will be.  I vote straight
Democrat every election.

Individual Liberty, property ownship, entrepreneurial business, our bill of
rights, our government as "of, for, and by the people," (all people) is
foundational to justice and human dignity.

Defending our constitution does not mean I am conservative; rather, it
means quite the opposite to me.

All, please let anyone know this.  I was hurt when I saw someone else hurt
after being told I was Republican and conservative.  That was untrue.  I
call Republicans and conservatives "evil" all the time.  They are stupid
and evil to me.  I work against them, as morally I must.

Gender identity is a choice.  You may make a choice or choose not even
to consider it.  No one should care.  You get to be you.  You don't
have too choose, but you may.

If you want you may change your choice at any time, choose a grey
spectrum between the binaries, choose as binary, fluididity, whatever.

Life is a path of creation and discovery.

Continued JBP YouTube video comment debate:
<pre>
Unfortunate, my side of the "debate" is the one suffering violence,
discrimination, and negative judgement just being ourselves.  We have
high suicide rates because of this.  We are not negatively judging
hetero-normative persons.  Such persons are judging us.

I know I'll never "win this debate," especially in a JBP video comment
thread, of all places, but such is unjust.

I know myself better than others know me.  I choose and create me.  It
is dangerous to judge my physical presentation and stated gender identity
as right or wrong because such are my choices.

I may change my mind in these choices.  Such is my right.

Many think gender identity is delusion, a sign of a problem.  Almost
always it is not.  It is a valid choice which generally enables individuals.
It is not a choice used to harm others, which some seem to fear, as much as
it is a choice which enables individuals to survive and thrive.

Gender identity, in general, improves individual health more than it harms.
There may be exceptions, but such exceptions are small compared to the
almost epidemic level of harm waged against us by much of our society.

				Our currently still coming in national election results are extremely terrifying.
				Over past last fews years the Republicans have denied an election, stormed our capital, overturned Roe vs. Wade, killed ~10^6 American's during a pandemic, ran the economy into the ground, gave a trillion dollar tax break to the filthy rich, decreased benefits to the elderly and the poor, reversed social advancements regarding minorities, attacked education, attacked medical science, and advocated for violence, intolerance, and discrimination against minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ+ persons, atheists, and religious minorities.
			</p><p>
				It is almost impossible to be worse or to have done worse.  They are evil.
			</p><p>
				Then I remember world history.  Republicans are anti-American, anti-humanity, anti-individual liberty, anti-compassion, anti-constitution.
			</p><p>
				WWII, the cold war, imperialism, facist regimes in asian and Russia, ...
			I'm terrified.  Why aren't they loosing?  Why are they winning?  The Biden administration has kicked ass.  We need more, but they have improved our society, economy, and civilization so remarkably.
			</p><p>
				Why aren't the democrats sweeping the house and the senate?
			I am terrified.  Even my new job's management has turned from liberal to conservative since we got acquired by another company.
			</p><p>
				Since coming out as gay/transgender I've lost every job I've had due to transphobia.  I lost my church, some friends, some family members.  I get yelled at, leered at, cat called by strangers.
			</p><p>
				I'm terrified.
			</p><p>
				My children can't afford college.  I'm barely  surviving pay check to pay check.  I have no car.  My healthcare expenses are far beyond my means.  I'm almost 50.
			</p><p>
				This is bad.
			</p><p>
				So many of the greatest Americans in history, even recent history were murdered. We have bombings, shootings, terrorist events, wars.
			</p><p>
				Our currently coming in election results are hitting me hard.  All I can do is continue to attempt to survive and find ways to help groups of others like me, progressives, liberals, democrats.
			</p><p>
				My hope is gone.  All I can do is survive.  This is wrong.

Q: When would you have transitioned if your culture had
   known about and accepted gender identity?
A: At birth.  Gender identity is innate, prenatal.

Q: What if you had decided later?
A: Then my decision must be respected.  I have every
   right to decided my gender identity for any reason
   I choose.  My reasons are my business.  In fact, I
   have every right to choose for no reason at all.

Q: If you just "choose" whenever you want to, then are
   you still valid?
A: Yes.  My freedom of choice defines my validity.

Q: What percentage of transgender persons do you think
   feel their gender identity was innate vs. simply a
   choice?
A: Most, seemingly almost all, transgender persons I
   have corresponded with and interacted with express
   that for them it was innate, expressed in their
   wants and play interests early on and later
   recognized in their own consciousness as it
   developed.

Summary:
Gender identity is innate driven by physical causes,
but our consciousness means that we each have full
freedom of choice.  Clearly it is unlikely that many
persons would choose a gender identity differing from
their physically characteristics, but they each have
every right to do so.  Respecting that right shows
respect for the soviergnty of each individual, and
beyond that, respect for the power of and absolute
soviergnty of each individual consciousness.

Nothing could be more American than individual
soviergnty.

Soviegnty of individual consciousness is.  Each and

This "equality of essence" must be defined so that it
may be protected culturally and legally.

The U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution
attempted to define individual essence through phases
like "certain inalienable rights" and "we hold these
truths to be self evident."  It stated rights are not
granted.  They preexist.  Some may be infringed upon,
but such infringements must express the reasons for
their legitimacy explicitly and individually.

Our founding documents attempted these definitions but

			<p>
<pre>
	In Congress, July 4, 1776.

	The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united
	States of America, When in the Course of human events,
	it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
	political bands which have connected them with
	another, and to assume among the powers of the earth,
	the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
	Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
	respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
	should declare the causes which impel them to the
	separation.

	We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
	are created equal, that they are endowed by their
	Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
	these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
	--That to secure these rights, Governments are
	instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from
	the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form
	of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
	the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and
	to institute new Government, laying its foundation on
	such principles and organizing its powers in such
	form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
	their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will
	dictate that Governments long established should not
	be changed for light and transient causes; and
	accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind
	are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
	sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the
	forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
	train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably
	the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
	absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their
	duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
	Guards for their future security.--Such has been the
	patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now
	the necessity which constrains them to alter their
	former Systems of Government. The history of the
	present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
	injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object
	the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these
	States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a
	candid world.

	He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome
	and necessary for the public good.

	He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of
	immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in
	their operation till his Assent should be obtained;
	and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
	attend to them.

	He has refused to pass other Laws for the
	accommodation of large districts of people, unless
	those people would relinquish the right of
	Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable
	to them and formidable to tyrants only.

	He has called together legislative bodies at places
	unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
	depository of their public Records, for the sole
	purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
	measures.

	He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for
	opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the
	rights of the people.

	He has refused for a long time, after such
	dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby
	the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation,
	have returned to the People at large for their
	exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed
	to all the dangers of invasion from without, and
	convulsions within.

	He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these
	States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for
	Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others
	to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the
	conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

	He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by
	refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary
	powers.

	He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for
	the tenure of their offices, and the amount and
	payment of their salaries.

	He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent
	hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and
	eat out their substance.

	He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing
	Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

	He has affected to render the Military independent of
	and superior to the Civil power.

	He has combined with others to subject us to a
	jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and
	unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their
	Acts of pretended Legislation:

	For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

	For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment
	for any Murders which they should commit on the
	Inhabitants of these States:

	For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

	For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

	For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of
	Trial by Jury:

	For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for
	pretended offences

	For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a
	neighbouring Province, establishing therein an
	Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so
	as to render it at once an example and fit instrument
	for introducing the same absolute rule into these
	Colonies:

	For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most
	valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of
	our Governments:

	For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring
	themselves invested with power to legislate for us in
	all cases whatsoever.

	He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out
	of his Protection and waging War against us.

	He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt
	our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

	He is at this time transporting large Armies of
	foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death,
	desolation and tyranny, already begun with
	circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled
	in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the
	Head of a civilized nation.

	He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive
	on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country,
	to become the executioners of their friends and
	Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

	He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and
	has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our
	frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known
	rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of
	all ages, sexes and conditions.

	In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned
	for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated
	Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
	A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act
	which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of
	a free people.

	Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish
	brethren. We have warned them from time to time of
	attempts by their legislature to extend an
	unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded
	them of the circumstances of our emigration and
	settlement here. We have appealed to their native
	justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by
	the ties of our common kindred to disavow these
	usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our
	connections and correspondence. They too have been
	deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We
	must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which
	denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold
	the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

	We, therefore, the Representatives of the united
	States of America, in General Congress, Assembled,
	appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the
	rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by
	Authority of the good People of these Colonies,
	solemnly publish and declare, That these United
	Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and
	Independent States; that they are Absolved from all
	Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all
	political connection between them and the State of
	Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;
	and that as Free and Independent States, they have
	full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract
	Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other
	Acts and Things which Independent States may of right
	do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a
	firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence,
	we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our
	Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

How Luciferians Differ from Satanists by Catherine Beyer

To the uninitiated, Satanists and Luciferians are often
considered to be one and the same thing. After all,
Luciferians and Satanists ( theistic as well as
LaVeyan/atheistic) both are named for the figure that
traditional Christians regard as the devil, the
embodiment of evil. But while the two groups do have a
lot in common, Luciferians view themselves as quite
separate from Satanists and by no means a subset.

The Luciferian Difference
The Luciferians view Satanists as being primarily
focused on the physical nature of man, exploring,
experimenting, and enjoying that nature while rejecting
any aspirations or effort rise beyond it. They believe
that Satanists see the figure of Satan as an emblem of
carnality and materiality. Luciferians, on the other
hand, view Lucifer as a spiritual and enlightened
being—one that does indeed rise above mere materiality.
While Luciferians do embrace the enjoyment of one's
life, they accept that there are greater and more
spiritual goals to be pursued and achieved.

Many among the Luciferians see Satan and Lucifer as
symbols of different aspects of the same being—the
carnal, rebellious and material Satan vs. the
enlightened and spiritual Lucifer.

Luciferians also tend to see Satanists as overly-
dependent on Christian understandings. From the
Luciferian perspective, Satanists embrace values such
as pleasure, success, and sexuality precisely because
the Chrisitan Church has traditionally condemned such
things. Luciferians do not see their choices as acts
as rebellion but instead, believe themselves to be
motivated by independent thought.

Luciferians put more emphasis on the balance of light
and dark, seeing Satanism as a more one-sided belief
system.

Similarities
The two traditions do, however, share much in common.
Satanism and Luciferianism are both highly
individualized religions. While there is no single set
of beliefs, rules, or dogmas for either group, some
generalities can be made. In general, both Satanists
and Luciferians:
 * View human beings as gods—beings who have mastery of
   the planet. Unlike the Christian relationship to
   Jesus, both Satanists and Luciferians pay respect to
   Lucifer rather than worship him. They are not
   subservient to Luciferbut believe he has many things
   to teach them.
 * Hold to a set of ethics that includes showing respect
   to those who deserve it and leaving alone those
   people who have caused no problems.
 * Support creativity, excellence, success, freedom,
   individuality, and enjoyment.
 * Reject dogmatic religion.
 * Are antagonistic toward Christianity, although not to
   Christians. Luciferians and Satanists view Christians
   as being victims of their own religion, too dependent
   on their religion to escape from it.
 * View Satan or Lucifer in a different manner than do
   Christians. Satan or Lucifer is not regarded as the
   embodiment of evil. To worship a being of true evil
   is regarded as the act of a psychopath for
   Luciferians and Satanists.

<b>How Can I Endure?</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
It is odd that I did not choose to be alive.  I did not
choose to be here and now.  I did not choose this body.

I am confronted at every turn by face value judgements
of me I can't control, judgments of parts of me I did
not control.

How can I endure this?

Twice I fell into someone and briefly them into me
which enabled us to hold each other, to celebrate each
other, to love each instance smiling at each other and
each and every aspect of each other.  To be with each
other.

Basically we are mammals.  What do mammals do?  They
mate.  That is what we do, we mate.  Our lives depend
on it.

But we have a problem, our minds.  What do minds do?  I
have no idea.  They suffer, I know that.

So, how do I endure?

I be and create something which turns me on.
Individuality we each create ourselves.

That is how I survive each day continually in suicidal
torment.  I become lightening.

 Every vent is an opportunity for improvement or celebration. Positivity

 I don't like CIS and heteronormative people judging me, but I don't get hung

 One Vent ⟶ One Opportunity (flip of its coin)

    * Being Stealth Judged (silently) ⟶ Pride knowing the secrecy is in them,

"Your points are responsible and true; however, I feel that for me my health

 following my freeings.

 We each are empowered this way, to define ourselves. It is our greatest
 responsibility and opportunity. We own the consequences. Taking that
 responsibility is maturity.

 Gender identity and gender transition are unique in being direct actions of
 individual empowerment over oppression and dogma. I view releasing the shadow

"The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie--
 deliberate, contrived and dishonest--but the myth--
 persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we
 hold fast to the cliches of our forebears. We subject
 all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations.
 We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort
 of thought.”

"Sure women are great, but is not becoming one even
 better?

 Evolution pushed women towards aesthetic beauty.  They
 competed with each other to seduce the best of the
 men. Meanwhile, the men were competing with each other
 to score the best of the women.  With science today a
 man can become a woman.  Is choosing to do this a good
 choice?  As a pansexual transgender, I think so.  Here
 is why.

 Aesthetic beauty is a wonderful measure.  It
 encompasses so much, truth, correctness, harmony,
 health, and more.  Human beings are incredible
 creatures.  We actively create future worlds.  We
 create feelings in each other. We join with each
 other, we share, we think, we talk.  Some say the
 phrase “made in God’s image” means this, that we
 consciously create future realities, that we are
 active agents in their selection.  In fact, this is
 what we do, rather consciously or not, it is what we
 do.

 My first responsibility is the creation of myself.
 What am I, what am I to others?  Also, which futures
 realities am I pushing reality towards?  As history is
 unchangeable, my every action gets burned into it for
 eternity. No take backs; therefore, my every action
 and thought count.

 So, as I create me, I choose MTF HRT and many other
 actions to become more beautiful.  It is my
 responsibility to do so.

 The answer to the question?  Yes, it is a good choice
 for a man to become a woman."

"The word "Dad" says a lot.  Keith was my Dad.

 He had a strong personality.  He was decisive,
 somewhat authoritative, which is good.  He sought
 correctness, I thought.  He used rigor.  He used
 study. He liked talking.  But most importantly, he was
 kind.

 I remember one night in high school after supper I
 walking off down our stairs toward my room.  He
 stopped me.  I looked up to him.  He said "Chad, you
 know you can become an engineer or a scientist if you
 want to just by doing it." From that night on I was an
 engineer.

 When I began searching colleges.  I was scared.  He
 said to me, "Chad, you know if you read their
 criteria, do them, apply, you may get in."  I did.

 Well, independent of such normal little things is what
 really matters, social responsibility, to care about
 others, to empathize, to feel love for self and for
 them despite everything, to have compassion, and
 mostly to be cautious, very cautious, in passing of
 judgement of others who possibly are no more guilty
 than I.

 When I wanted advice, Dad was there.  When I asked
 for help, Dad provided. When I wanted to share ideas,
 Dad listened.  That was love.  I loved you too, Dad.

 Thank you."

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan B. Peterson is wrong, life is not worth living.  "God" was right when he wiped us out.  We are not good.  Bye.<br>
		<p>
		I had become disillusioned from negative judgements online, in public, family, church, the office, so much so that I resigned
		in the above.  I went to tweet it prossibly pleading for help, I don't know, but what I saw is inspiring.  Jordan Peterson Quotes saw
		my earlier tweet celebrating his most recent philosophical accomplishment and liked it.  Thank you existence for myself
		and thank you Jordan B. Peterson for yourself.  You are beautiful as truth is beautiful and responsibility mandatory.

		<pre>
	Its been a while since I've seen your face,
	Got to say that I'm happy to see you come around my place.
	Now I think we've talked about it and I think I know what's coming up next,
	Lets put our minds away and let our hormones do the rest.

	Does it seem obscene, does it seem like a bad thing.
	Well if it is I'm sorry miss, but you know I'm just nineteen.
	So don't be afraid when my pants start to leak, you know damn well
	I'm in my sexual peak.

	Why won't you have some dirty hot sex with me.
	It ain't like I'm askin' ya to give it up for free.
	We can start it right now baby get on you knees,
	Don't make me beg again girl I just said please.

	Now when you look down don't be misled.
	I found my life's purpose and it's getting up stairs into your bed.
	Well there's the phone girl go right on ahead.
	I'm sure you'd rather be with your stupid boyfriend
	Instead.
	...

<blockquote>
<pre>
"What I like is how much work it takes for me as a man
 to become feminine and that the work never ends. To me
 everything feminine is wonderful because it is
 balanced. It is considered. It must all matched
 together, and it must be pretty. Pretty is no small
 thing. It is the largest thing, really. It includes
 every thought, every feelings, every action, and all
 other people's responses. It may happen naturally for
 women but not always for men. Men's bodies are built
 for action. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like men,
 and they are pretty, but women are prettier. Their
 skin is perfect, their shape non-threatening, their
 voices soft, their motions fluid and enticing. They
 are amazing creatures. They evolved for their social
 response. I am a man but I don't want to beat other
 men up. I don't want to win women over them. I want
 all of us to rise together into the most resplendent
 thing possible. Yes, there can be discord in a man
 expressing feminity, but there doesn't have to be. If
 it feels good to me, then it is good is what I see.
 Some appreciate it, which is so joyous I can't tell
 you. So why not, I say?"

"For me it is that being feminine-male is beautiful and
 sophisticated head to toe, inside to outside. My
 physical fitness must be balanced toward feminity.  My
 behaviors and manners must be gracious, submissive,
 show enthralment in others. My makeup takes study,
 practice, style, detail. It communicates a lot. My
 clothing, jewelry, other-ware every detail matters.
 Interior design,
 ...

 For me being pretty/devoted-to-others-happiness/
 feminine means being and bringing grace, beauty,
 happiness, and positivity to the world."

"Beautiful feet are a sign of great health.  As they
 contain 26 bones, 33 joints (20 of which are actively
 articulated), and more than a hundred muscles,
 tendons, and ligaments, they showcase their owner's
 genetics, this Tiffany feels.  Even our instincts have
 taught us to appreciate them and to care for them.
 So, paint yours nails pink, nurture your skin, and
 celebrate your feet as they are you and you are
 beautiful!"
