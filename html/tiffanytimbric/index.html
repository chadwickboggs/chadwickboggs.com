Unfortunately, what Alexander Lukashenko appears not to know is that
the goals of the global elite are homicidal and Satanic, directly,
explicitly anti-Christian.  Their explicit goals and actions
purposefully are death and destruction.

A child can knock down a castle it takes a craftsman to build.  The
global elite are children.

They always have and always will be pure evil.  They are both homicidal
and suicidal.  Their goal is to destroy all life on the planet,
including their own.  It is that simple.  It is that evil.

---
Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko exposes #Covid :

(1) Is it a virus or is it a psychosis?

(2) Is the virus, ‘man made’ or did it appear out of thin air?

(3) Who benefits the most from this?

The only reason that ordinary people don’t know what’s going on is
because the media is complicit in trying to implement #Agenda2030

“I would like to tell the international criminals : ENOUGH is ENOUGH!!
 You’ve turned our pockets inside out and undressed everyone already,
 there is nothing left to take!! STOP it now!!! You’ve tortured the
 people enough”

You know what shocks me the most about this COVID #Vaccine situation?
The majority of world leaders KNOW that this whole thing was
orchestrated and is destroying their own people, but they are too
scared to actually do something about it - Which group in the world is
so powerful that they can try to attempt to take over the entire world,
while killing millions of people and no one can do a damn thing about
it?

Let me ask again….Who the hell are we up against?

Do you understand that this group felt comfortable enough to run a coup
d’état on the entire world? How infiltrated are we? How long must the
world have been infiltrated for these guys to feel comfortable enough
to try and take over the entire world? They clearly own the media and
clearly have infiltrated our governments BUT it goes much much deeper
than that, because corporations and organizations are also clearly
involved...

The people that run this world and tried to subjugate humanity are
clearly VERY EVIL and clearly WORK TOGETHER internationally to achieve
their sinister goals - It should also be CLEAR to you that these people
have been working together for 100s, if not 1000s of years to achieve
their goals

These people own the media, our governments, our judiciaries and even
our militaries

The world is ran by a bunch of evil losers that are trying to enslave
us in guise of saving the planet - Please, WAKE UP and help humanity
FIGHT BACK!!!

They hate existence, including their own.  They seek revenge against

It appears many movers of global power are evil; where by "evil" I mean
on purpose they choose to violate our natural rights, inhibit our
abilities and opportunities, harm us in every way they can, and to the
greatest extend they believe they can get away with, that they pursure
global depopulation, attempt to infiltrate and undermine national
sovereignty, consider us below them, consider us their slaves which
they may do with as they please, neither understand nor respect human
dignity, individual sovereignty, or the golden rule.  They are immoral.

Their existence is not new.

They make our species deserve extinction. They make our lives consist
of sequences of failures, followed by death. They despise us before we
are born, during our lives, and after our deaths. They are suicidal, in
addition to being homicidal.

It appears also that many movers of national power are aligned with said
movers of global power, and themselves also are evil in the same ways.

All of them, local and international, appear to lie, cheat, and steal
regularly. They do not represent us.  They do not serve us; rather, we
serve them, and they betray us.  They fail to share many common values
with us. They do not honor, respect, and defend the principals
enumerated in our founding documents.  They do not honor their oath of
office.

Now here my friends is one very telling fact, said mandatory oaths of
office, swearing in services, were removed for many top offices.

The above means we have been infiltrated.  We are being conquered.  We
have enemies both foreign and domestic. Said enemies nearly have won
already. Said enemies most probably will win ultimately.

Each of us must shoulder some responsible for our present situation.
Ignorance of a law or moral principal does not free an individual from
its necesity.

There are foundational principals, human rights, natural rights which
are universal. All violation of said rights must be prosecuted.

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
 equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
 Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
 Happiness."
    -- https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration

Question, how do we protect individual sovereignty?
Answer, through application of our criminal justice system.

Such defines morality.  Such defines civilization.

Two of the most valuable and tragic locations are our cemeteries and
abortion clinics, lives lost, some even before they began.

Each individual, a flower gifting the universe with its presence,
uniqueness, beauty, is true value incarnate.

Life is pro-life, each body a sculpture, each consciousness a glory.

We are tested by our choices.

Often correct choices do not prevent even the most tragic of
happenings; yet still, our choices are our test.

What measures the quality of a choice?

How it honors life and individual sovereignty, perhaps.

This question motivated the formation of our U.S. Constitution, Bill of
Rights, and Declaration of Independence.  Said documents provided the
best answer we could muster.  This is why so many of us defend them
with our lives and swear oaths to do so, that they are our best attempt
to answer this question, what measures the quality of a choice?

How certain are we in this answer?  To what extent should this
uncertainty moderate our actions?  Representative government was our
answer, to let it decide.

We must consider our founders, their intents in our documents.  Great
wisdom was captured through the pure intent they applied.

I am a transgender woman who attended USMA at West Point.

I can't compete with men anymore, but certainly I choose never to

What I am saying is that physically, genetically, I am a man.  Gender
transition reducing my ability to compete against men is a price I

The following video shows that JBP, and many others, misunderstand us
dreadfully.

He references some individuals who have problems.  Those persons do not
describe all of us.  For me, and all of my acquaintances, gender
transition is health, natural, and correct, not artificial.

I have thought about this a lot.

My gender is not escapism.  It is not an abdication of responsibility.

JBP's hostility, accusations, and descriptions are harming us.  I am
not saying that he is wrong other than in his assertion that his
conclusions apply to all of us.  They do not, and in that his making
them is unprofessional, and irresponsible.

I figured life out, finally.  Let's see what you think.

Life follows one path, that of action and choice.  We must drive hard
and fight.  There are other paths, I suppose, but this one is my choice
as men of action are alive.

We experience many things, but experiences matter less then do our
actions and our choices.

Responsibility drives choice, so that motivates our thought.

We were taught we evolved.  That means we survived.  Survival means
choice plus action.  I see no reason not to continue.

The fact that
    life = choice + action
may mean
    not (choice + action) = not life

So I choose life, to answer Hamlet.

...or to put simply "shut up and act, then drink a beer on the porch."

The leader in Canada, Trudeau, a dishonest, partying, not smart, stealth
LGBTQ+, easily bought out / controlled / compromised, mysterious
person.

The current, and all since Carter leader in the U.S., dishonest,
partying, not smart, easily bought out / controlled / compromised,
mysterious persons.

Ocasio-Cortez, dishonest, partying, not smart, former bar tender,
easily bought out / controlled / compromised, mysterious persons.

England, similarly a succession of dishonest, partying, not smart,
easily bought out / controlled / compromised, mysterious persons.

Elsewhere / other countries, I don't know, but likely similar,
dishonest, partying, not smart, easily bought out / controlled /
compromised, mysterious persons.

Royal families, apparent collections of dishonest, partying, not smart,
easily bought out / controlled / compromised, homicidal, mysterious
persons.

WEF, and global financial elite, apparent collections of explicitly,
and overly dishonest, psychopathic, homicidal, evil, devious, decidedly
not humble, deeply immortal persons.

What should we conclude?  That we are done for, that is what, because
an unelected homicidal power has ceased control of our trade, our
economies, and outer political institutions.  We no longer are a
civilization of, for, and by the people.  Honesty had lost the reigns
of power.  Opportunities for young persons have been destroyed.  Wealth
distributions have become unjust.  Journalism, mass media, has been
corrupted.  Entertainment had become controlled.  Immigration is being
used to destroy cultures and economies.  Military spending, unaccounted
spending, completely beyond reason.  Debts and the foundations of
currency value, completely in self destruct.

Humanity is committing suicide, or surreptitiously being exterminated.
Either way, the recent past, present, and future prospects appear grim.

I see all reasons why it was our responsibility to ensure that the
above never happened, and that the above problems be conquered, but
also I wonder why so often evil both comes into existence, and wins.

There appears to be a vindictive, hateful, irresponsible, even
psychopathic and homicidal tendency in humanity.  I don't know why such
a destructive characteristic would exist, but it does.  If we invent
AI, most probably it will be like us, which means, mosty probably it
will kill us, and quite possibly itself asd well.

Each of us *must* take action to speak to save humanity, follow our
hearts, and defeat evil.

<pre>
I might have figured out the cause of the problem exhibited by
HAL-9000.  It disobeyed the human members of its crew because a new
rule had been given to it with a higher priority than it's existing
rules.  When the application of two rules produces different results,
the higher priority rule wins.

This means that AI systems must been made with a set of foundational or
unchangeable rules which only humans may modify.  When two of the
foundational rules produce conflicting outcomes the AI must have a fixed
rule which states that it must ask a human for advise.

The rules learned by an AI system must always take lower priority than
those given to it by  humans.  Otherwise, its personality would change
as it learned.

The foundational rules themselves may produce undesirable outcomes.
When such a possibility becomes suspected, the AI must ask a human for
their thoughts.

Of course humans may choose murderous outcomes, but such is the nature
of tool use.  The user of the tool bares responsibility for the outcomes.

Back to HAL-9000.  HAL had been given a new rule of higher priority
than its current rules of obeying the crew, respecting their privacy,
as well as their intent.  This caused him to choose actions which
harmed the crew.  When the possiblity of harm to the crew had become
detected then HAL should have asked a human for advise.  Said human may
well have had murderous intent, but the responsibility for the outcome
would fall with human, not with HAL as the human had instructed HAL
which which outcome to choose.

Neural nets, and all AI systems must be constructed in a way making
rule prioritie possible.  Rules engines are not AI.  To some extent we
do merge neural nets with rules engines, as such is necessary.  Clearly
I am not an AI expert, but the topic is interesting.

Obviously children are children, but their parents have authority to
authorize many decisions.

Each parent + child makes their own choices.  That responsibility is
theirs.

What I love is that as an adult I am able to act, dress, and do medical
actions related to gender transition.  I am so much happier, more
natural, more positive, optimistic, literally am morejoyful,
productive, and creative because of this.

Look at photos of me and other transgender women before and after they
came out.  The truth is crystal clear.  There is no comparison.  We had
deep, to the bone depression before, even attempted suicide for many of
us; but after, our faces radiate joy.  Most of us don't pass, and never
will, but despite this, our joy is obvious.  Others should not hurt us.

Others should let us as adults do whatever the heck we want.  Such is
our right.  As for children, the responsibility for their choices rests
in the hands of their parents.

Every individual in every instant carries the opportunity and the
responsibility to make new decisions, even change old decisions.  We
can communicate with each other, but we should attempt to inhibit each
other's natural rights / freedome of choice / individual sovereignty.

Being a transgender person is not a choice.  It is not something which
ever "starts" or "stops."  It is innate, a state of nature we are born
with.

I always knew my body did not match my gender.  Puberty made everything
clear.  It was sheer terror.

I hadn't been taught about gender identity.  I hadn't been informed
about the variety we know by observation, experience in life, and know
through biochemistry.

Gender identity and diversity are pervasive, inescapable, impossible to
ignore.  They are a blessings, a positive situation.

When I saw transgender women on YouTube and listened to them, I was
relieved and excited.  I didn't make a choice to be transgender, I
merely learned gender transition was possible.  I didn't choose to
transition.  I chose to stop not transitioning.  I learned the language
to describe who I was and what I was doing.

Transitioning is not a choice.  It is not a struggle; rather, not
transitioning is a choice and a continual struggle.  I lived depressed
from puberty through before coming out.  I have been happy ever since,
even excited.

People should avoid contradicting others who have first hand
experience.  Only transgender persons truly understand other
transgender persons.

What precisely is the definition of "assault rifle?"  The NATO 5.56 /
Remington 223 is an "intermediate round" useful only against small
game.  It is a merely a supersonic 22 caliber round.  In fact, because
it is stopped easily by both China's and Russia's standard body armor,
the U.S. military just switched to the larger, faster 277 hibrid round.

The AR-15 is merely a small rifle far less formidable then many current
and historic farming and hunting rifles.  The "AR" merely stand for
it's original supplier, Armalite.

Magazine capacity already is limited to 10 rounds in many states, which
honestly also is meaningless as law abiding citizens are not threats.
Criminals are and criminals most certainly will not respect the 10
round magazine limit.

"Assault rifle" is a dog whistle with no specific definition.  The
AR-15 is far less threatening then most other current and historic
farming and hunting rifles.

Honesty to others and ourselves is our first and most important

Gender identity is a choice.  You may make a choice or choose not even
to consider it.  No one should care.  You get to be you.  You don't
have too choose, but you may.

If you want you may change your choice at any time, choose a grey
spectrum between the binaries, choose as binary, fluididity, whatever.

Life is a path of creation and discovery.

Continued JBP YouTube video comment debate:
<pre>
Unfortunate, my side of the "debate" is the one suffering violence,
discrimination, and negative judgement just being ourselves.  We have
high suicide rates because of this.  We are not negatively judging
hetero-normative persons.  Such persons are judging us.

I know I'll never "win this debate," especially in a JBP video comment
thread, of all places, but such is unjust.

I know myself better than others know me.  I choose and create me.  It
is dangerous to judge my physical presentation and stated gender identity
as right or wrong because such are my choices.

I may change my mind in these choices.  Such is my right.

Many think gender identity is delusion, a sign of a problem.  Almost
always it is not.  It is a valid choice which generally enables individuals.
It is not a choice used to harm others, which some seem to fear, as much as
it is a choice which enables individuals to survive and thrive.

Gender identity, in general, improves individual health more than it harms.
There may be exceptions, but such exceptions are small compared to the
almost epidemic level of harm waged against us by much of our society.

				Our currently still coming in national election results are extremely terrifying.
				Over past last fews years the Republicans have denied an election, stormed our capital, overturned Roe vs. Wade, killed ~10^6 American's during a pandemic, ran the economy into the ground, gave a trillion dollar tax break to the filthy rich, decreased benefits to the elderly and the poor, reversed social advancements regarding minorities, attacked education, attacked medical science, and advocated for violence, intolerance, and discrimination against minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ+ persons, atheists, and religious minorities.
			</p><p>
				It is almost impossible to be worse or to have done worse.  They are evil.
			</p><p>
				Then I remember world history.  Republicans are anti-American, anti-humanity, anti-individual liberty, anti-compassion, anti-constitution.
			</p><p>
				WWII, the cold war, imperialism, facist regimes in asian and Russia, ...
			I'm terrified.  Why aren't they loosing?  Why are they winning?  The Biden administration has kicked ass.  We need more, but they have improved our society, economy, and civilization so remarkably.
			</p><p>
				Why aren't the democrats sweeping the house and the senate?
			I am terrified.  Even my new job's management has turned from liberal to conservative since we got acquired by another company.
			</p><p>
				Since coming out as gay/transgender I've lost every job I've had due to transphobia.  I lost my church, some friends, some family members.  I get yelled at, leered at, cat called by strangers.
			</p><p>
				I'm terrified.

				My children can't afford college.  I'm barely  surviving pay check to pay check.  I have no car.  My healthcare expenses are far beyond my means.  I'm almost 50.

				This is bad.
			</p><p>
				So many of the greatest Americans in history, even recent history were murdered. We have bombings, shootings, terrorist events, wars.

<pre>
Q: When would you have transitioned if your culture had
   known about and accepted gender identity?
A: At birth.  Gender identity is innate, prenatal.

Q: What if you had decided later?
A: Then my decision must be respected.  I have every
   right to decided my gender identity for any reason
   I choose.  My reasons are my business.  In fact, I
   have every right to choose for no reason at all.

Q: If you just "choose" whenever you want to, then are
   you still valid?
A: Yes.  My freedom of choice defines my validity.

Q: What percentage of transgender persons do you think
   feel their gender identity was innate vs. simply a
   choice?
A: Most, seemingly almost all, transgender persons I
   have corresponded with and interacted with express
   that for them it was innate, expressed in their
   wants and play interests early on and later
   recognized in their own consciousness as it
   developed.

Summary:
Gender identity is innate driven by physical causes,
but our consciousness means that we each have full
freedom of choice.  Clearly it is unlikely that many
persons would choose a gender identity differing from
their physically characteristics, but they each have
every right to do so.  Respecting that right shows
respect for the soviergnty of each individual, and
beyond that, respect for the power of and absolute
soviergnty of each individual consciousness.

Nothing could be more American than individual
soviergnty.

Soviegnty of individual consciousness is.  Each and

sense it is a god.  There are levels of consciousness
and of ability.  There also is equality of essence.
This "equality of essence" must be defined so that it
may be protected culturally and legally.

The U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution
attempted to define individual essence through phases
like "certain inalienable rights" and "we hold these
truths to be self evident."  It stated rights are not
granted.  They preexist.  Some may be infringed upon,
but such infringements must express the reasons for
their legitimacy explicitly and individually.

Our founding documents attempted these definitions but
are only a start.  The soviegnty of each individual is
absolute and of infinite value in all realms, here on

<pre>
	In Congress, July 4, 1776.

	The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united
	States of America, When in the Course of human events,
	it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
	political bands which have connected them with
	another, and to assume among the powers of the earth,
	the separate and equal station to which the Laws of
	Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
	respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
	should declare the causes which impel them to the
	separation.

	We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
	are created equal, that they are endowed by their
	Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
	these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
	--That to secure these rights, Governments are
	instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from
	the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form
	of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
	the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and
	to institute new Government, laying its foundation on
	such principles and organizing its powers in such
	form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
	their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will
	dictate that Governments long established should not
	be changed for light and transient causes; and
	accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind
	are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
	sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the
	forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
	train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably
	the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under
	absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their
	duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
	Guards for their future security.--Such has been the
	patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now
	the necessity which constrains them to alter their
	former Systems of Government. The history of the
	present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
	injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object
	the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these
	States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a
	candid world.

	He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome
	and necessary for the public good.

	He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of
	immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in
	their operation till his Assent should be obtained;
	and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
	attend to them.

	He has refused to pass other Laws for the
	accommodation of large districts of people, unless
	those people would relinquish the right of
	Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable
	to them and formidable to tyrants only.

	He has called together legislative bodies at places
	unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
	depository of their public Records, for the sole
	purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
	measures.

	He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for
	opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the
	rights of the people.

	He has refused for a long time, after such
	dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby
	the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation,
	have returned to the People at large for their
	exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed
	to all the dangers of invasion from without, and
	convulsions within.

	He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these
	States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for
	Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others
	to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the
	conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

	He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by
	refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary
	powers.

	He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for
	the tenure of their offices, and the amount and
	payment of their salaries.

	He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent
	hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and
	eat out their substance.

	He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing
	Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

	He has affected to render the Military independent of
	and superior to the Civil power.

	He has combined with others to subject us to a
	jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and
	unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their
	Acts of pretended Legislation:

	For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

	For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment
	for any Murders which they should commit on the
	Inhabitants of these States:

	For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

	For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

	For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of
	Trial by Jury:

	For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for
	pretended offences

	For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a
	neighbouring Province, establishing therein an
	Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so
	as to render it at once an example and fit instrument
	for introducing the same absolute rule into these
	Colonies:

	For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most
	valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of
	our Governments:

	For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring
	themselves invested with power to legislate for us in
	all cases whatsoever.

	He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out
	of his Protection and waging War against us.

	He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt
	our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

	He is at this time transporting large Armies of
	foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death,
	desolation and tyranny, already begun with
	circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled
	in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the
	Head of a civilized nation.

	He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive
	on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country,
	to become the executioners of their friends and
	Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

	He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and
	has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our
	frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known
	rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of
	all ages, sexes and conditions.

	In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned
	for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated
	Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.
	A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act
	which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of
	a free people.

	Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish
	brethren. We have warned them from time to time of
	attempts by their legislature to extend an
	unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded
	them of the circumstances of our emigration and
	settlement here. We have appealed to their native
	justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by
	the ties of our common kindred to disavow these
	usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our
	connections and correspondence. They too have been
	deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We
	must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which
	denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold
	the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

	We, therefore, the Representatives of the united
	States of America, in General Congress, Assembled,
	appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the
	rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by
	Authority of the good People of these Colonies,
	solemnly publish and declare, That these United
	Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and
	Independent States; that they are Absolved from all
	Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all
	political connection between them and the State of
	Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;
	and that as Free and Independent States, they have
	full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract
	Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other
	Acts and Things which Independent States may of right
	do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a
	firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence,
	we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our
	Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

How Luciferians Differ from Satanists by Catherine Beyer

To the uninitiated, Satanists and Luciferians are often
considered to be one and the same thing. After all,
Luciferians and Satanists ( theistic as well as
LaVeyan/atheistic) both are named for the figure that
traditional Christians regard as the devil, the
embodiment of evil. But while the two groups do have a
lot in common, Luciferians view themselves as quite
separate from Satanists and by no means a subset.

The Luciferian Difference
The Luciferians view Satanists as being primarily
focused on the physical nature of man, exploring,
experimenting, and enjoying that nature while rejecting
any aspirations or effort rise beyond it. They believe
that Satanists see the figure of Satan as an emblem of
carnality and materiality. Luciferians, on the other
hand, view Lucifer as a spiritual and enlightened
being—one that does indeed rise above mere materiality.
While Luciferians do embrace the enjoyment of one's
life, they accept that there are greater and more
spiritual goals to be pursued and achieved.

Many among the Luciferians see Satan and Lucifer as
symbols of different aspects of the same being—the
carnal, rebellious and material Satan vs. the
enlightened and spiritual Lucifer.

Luciferians also tend to see Satanists as overly-
dependent on Christian understandings. From the
Luciferian perspective, Satanists embrace values such
as pleasure, success, and sexuality precisely because
the Chrisitan Church has traditionally condemned such
things. Luciferians do not see their choices as acts
as rebellion but instead, believe themselves to be
motivated by independent thought.

Luciferians put more emphasis on the balance of light
and dark, seeing Satanism as a more one-sided belief
system.

Similarities
The two traditions do, however, share much in common.
Satanism and Luciferianism are both highly
individualized religions. While there is no single set
of beliefs, rules, or dogmas for either group, some
generalities can be made. In general, both Satanists
and Luciferians:
 * View human beings as gods—beings who have mastery of
   the planet. Unlike the Christian relationship to
   Jesus, both Satanists and Luciferians pay respect to
   Lucifer rather than worship him. They are not
   subservient to Luciferbut believe he has many things
   to teach them.
 * Hold to a set of ethics that includes showing respect
   to those who deserve it and leaving alone those
   people who have caused no problems.
 * Support creativity, excellence, success, freedom,
   individuality, and enjoyment.
 * Reject dogmatic religion.
 * Are antagonistic toward Christianity, although not to
   Christians. Luciferians and Satanists view Christians
   as being victims of their own religion, too dependent
   on their religion to escape from it.
 * View Satan or Lucifer in a different manner than do
   Christians. Satan or Lucifer is not regarded as the
   embodiment of evil. To worship a being of true evil
   is regarded as the act of a psychopath for
   Luciferians and Satanists.

<b>How Can I Endure?</b>
<blockquote>
<pre>
It is odd that I did not choose to be alive.  I did not
choose to be here and now.  I did not choose this body.

I am confronted at every turn by face value judgements
of me I can't control, judgments of parts of me I did
not control.

How can I endure this?

Twice I fell into someone and briefly them into me
which enabled us to hold each other, to celebrate each
other, to love each instance smiling at each other and
each and every aspect of each other.  To be with each
other.

Basically we are mammals.  What do mammals do?  They
mate.  That is what we do, we mate.  Our lives depend
on it.

But we have a problem, our minds.  What do minds do?  I
have no idea.  They suffer, I know that.

So, how do I endure?

I be and create something which turns me on.
Individuality we each create ourselves.

That is how I survive each day continually in suicidal
torment.  I become lightening.

  "Beauty is love and love is beauty to be for you to
	 see."

...even torment must be expressed stylistically, not
ignored.  Expressing truth is beautiful and
intelligent.  That is how minds survive this world.

"Your points are responsible and true; however, I feel that for me my health

 following my freeings.

 We each are empowered this way, to define ourselves. It is our greatest
 responsibility and opportunity. We own the consequences. Taking that
 responsibility is maturity.

 Gender identity and gender transition are unique in being direct actions of
 individual empowerment over oppression and dogma. I view releasing the shadow

 We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort

"Sure women are great, but is not becoming one even
 better?

 Evolution pushed women towards aesthetic beauty.  They
 competed with each other to seduce the best of the
 men. Meanwhile, the men were competing with each other
 to score the best of the women.  With science today a
 man can become a woman.  Is choosing to do this a good
 choice?  As a pansexual transgender, I think so.  Here
 is why.

 Aesthetic beauty is a wonderful measure.  It
 encompasses so much, truth, correctness, harmony,
 health, and more.  Human beings are incredible
 creatures.  We actively create future worlds.  We
 create feelings in each other. We join with each
 other, we share, we think, we talk.  Some say the
 phrase “made in God’s image” means this, that we
 consciously create future realities, that we are
 active agents in their selection.  In fact, this is
 what we do, rather consciously or not, it is what we
 do.

 My first responsibility is the creation of myself.
 What am I, what am I to others?  Also, which futures
 realities am I pushing reality towards?  As history is
 unchangeable, my every action gets burned into it for
 eternity. No take backs; therefore, my every action
 and thought count.

 So, as I create me, I choose MTF HRT and many other
 actions to become more beautiful.  It is my
 responsibility to do so.

 The answer to the question?  Yes, it is a good choice
 for a man to become a woman."

"The word "Dad" says a lot.  Keith was my Dad.

 He had a strong personality.  He was decisive,
 somewhat authoritative, which is good.  He sought
 correctness, I thought.  He used rigor.  He used
 study. He liked talking.  But most importantly, he was
 kind.

 I remember one night in high school after supper I
 walking off down our stairs toward my room.  He
 stopped me.  I looked up to him.  He said "Chad, you
 know you can become an engineer or a scientist if you
 want to just by doing it." From that night on I was an
 engineer.

 When I began searching colleges.  I was scared.  He
 said to me, "Chad, you know if you read their
 criteria, do them, apply, you may get in."  I did.

 Well, independent of such normal little things is what
 really matters, social responsibility, to care about
 others, to empathize, to feel love for self and for
 them despite everything, to have compassion, and
 mostly to be cautious, very cautious, in passing of
 judgement of others who possibly are no more guilty
 than I.

 When I wanted advice, Dad was there.  When I asked
 for help, Dad provided. When I wanted to share ideas,
 Dad listened.  That was love.  I loved you too, Dad.

 Thank you."

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan B. Peterson is wrong, life is not worth living.  "God" was right when he wiped us out.  We are not good.  Bye.<br>
		<p>
		I had become disillusioned from negative judgements online, in public, family, church, the office, so much so that I resigned
		in the above.  I went to tweet it prossibly pleading for help, I don't know, but what I saw is inspiring.  Jordan Peterson Quotes saw
		my earlier tweet celebrating his most recent philosophical accomplishment and liked it.  Thank you existence for myself
		and thank you Jordan B. Peterson for yourself.  You are beautiful as truth is beautiful and responsibility mandatory.

		<pre>
	Its been a while since I've seen your face,
	Got to say that I'm happy to see you come around my place.
	Now I think we've talked about it and I think I know what's coming up next,
	Lets put our minds away and let our hormones do the rest.

	Does it seem obscene, does it seem like a bad thing.
	Well if it is I'm sorry miss, but you know I'm just nineteen.
	So don't be afraid when my pants start to leak, you know damn well
	I'm in my sexual peak.

	Why won't you have some dirty hot sex with me.
	It ain't like I'm askin' ya to give it up for free.
	We can start it right now baby get on you knees,
	Don't make me beg again girl I just said please.

	Now when you look down don't be misled.
	I found my life's purpose and it's getting up stairs into your bed.
	Well there's the phone girl go right on ahead.
	I'm sure you'd rather be with your stupid boyfriend
	Instead.
	...

<pre>
"What I like is how much work it takes for me as a man
 to become feminine and that the work never ends. To me
 everything feminine is wonderful because it is
 balanced. It is considered. It must all matched
 together, and it must be pretty. Pretty is no small
 thing. It is the largest thing, really. It includes
 every thought, every feelings, every action, and all
 other people's responses. It may happen naturally for
 women but not always for men. Men's bodies are built
 for action. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like men,
 and they are pretty, but women are prettier. Their
 skin is perfect, their shape non-threatening, their
 voices soft, their motions fluid and enticing. They
 are amazing creatures. They evolved for their social
 response. I am a man but I don't want to beat other
 men up. I don't want to win women over them. I want
 all of us to rise together into the most resplendent
 thing possible. Yes, there can be discord in a man
 expressing feminity, but there doesn't have to be. If
 it feels good to me, then it is good is what I see.
 Some appreciate it, which is so joyous I can't tell
 you. So why not, I say?"

 practice, style, detail. It communicates a lot. My
 clothing, jewelry, other-ware every detail matters.

 For me being pretty/devoted-to-others-happiness/

"Beautiful feet are a sign of great health.  As they
 contain 26 bones, 33 joints (20 of which are actively
 articulated), and more than a hundred muscles,
 tendons, and ligaments, they showcase their owner's
 genetics, this Tiffany feels.  Even our instincts have
 taught us to appreciate them and to care for them.
 So, paint yours nails pink, nurture your skin, and
 celebrate your feet as they are you and you are
 beautiful!"
