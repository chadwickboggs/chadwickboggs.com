Tiffany Timbric (tiffanytimbric@gmail.com)
Enterprise Backend Software Engineer

Overview
A senior enterprise backend software developer passionate about great code.  I write mission-critical system backends across many business domains, financial, transportation, telecommunications, e-commerce, defense, etc.  Starting at Sun Microsystems, Inc. I assisted their clients in system architectura and methodology, but especially in JEE code quality.
Recently atAmtrak, PayPal, Tendril, Charter Communications, JDA Software Group, I coded Web Services and large data processing optimizing read response time and scalability (#of concurrent requests/second).

10k ft. View of Tiffany's Consciousness
I designed and coded application and persistence systems for JDA Software Group, Tendril, Etilize, Packexpo, and others which handled large databases requiring Map Reduce / Hadoop + Pig Scripts, Cassandra NoSQL per-instances caching, pre-Cassandra custom caching for RedPrairie, distributed file systems, Table Sharding, Master-Slave read-write DB separation for horizontally scalable read operations, MemSql single threaded multi-instances in-memory NoSql'y equivalent scaling with RDB ACID + Atomic immediate consistency constraints, Reactive eXtentions (RxJava + Flow) Event driven design, and functional programming + Java Streams with Virtual Threads to fully utilize multi-core hardware, in-memory pre/post IO-bound data encryption (Lzop) enabling large data transfer, daily summary table updates enabling fast reads of enormous data tables, materialized views, PostgreSQL data integrity constraints, Quantum computer attack resistant data pre/post network encryption, etc.
In other words, I have designed and coded/implemented core foundational systems for premiere corporate and DOD companies with example-ready code quality. I attempt to write correct and aesthetic code. Things like rx-backpressure, network bulkheads (configurable retries + circuit breakers), client-side load balancing (Ribbon from Netflix), Scala, Kotlin, Mosh (mobile shell - https://mosh.org), Fish Shell (mobile shell – https://fishshell.com), etc. excite me.
