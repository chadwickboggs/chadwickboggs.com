Overview
  Writing enterprise server software leveraging Java, Reactive Extensions, Kotlin, Scala, SQL, Cassandra, Hadoop, HDFS, Bash, Cucumber, Fish Shell, Finagle, Google Protocol Buffers, OSGi, Mockito, Wiremock, JUnit, YAML, sometimes front-end stuff, is my daily pursuit. I know of but have not used Swift, HTTP/2. I've done some Android and iOS coding. I'm strong with Unix, Linux, tmux, Amazon Web Service, Puppet, and Zookeeper, Jetty, Tomcat, JBoss, Spring. I use IntelliJ IDEA, and Atlassian tools. Apple OS-X with Homebrew or MacPorts or Fink is good.

  Employment-wise, I worked at Sun Microsystems, Inc. within software engineering and as a Java Consultant to their clients teaching architecture, methodology, and design and coding (RUP, UP, SunTone, Agile, patterns). I later worked at RedPrairie/JDA Software Group as a Senior Engineer doing OSGi SOA and leading one new product teams. I was a Senior Architect at Packexpo, Inc.. I plan to continue this stuff, writing and operating beautiful code, collaboratively realizing business value through software.

Stories
  RxJava
    I used RxJava within server-side service code and around in inter-service calls on one item trading website.

  Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    I used AWS EC2, S3, VPC, SQS, SNS, and other services for the mission critical customer services micro-services and application integration at Charter Communications.

  Cucumber
    I used it for interaction between business, development, and testing at one company and prototyped it for another.

  Kotlin
    I have studied Kotlin and Reactive Extensions done with Kotlin and find it more productive in general than either Java or Scala.

  Scala
    I completed Coursera's Scala training worked with Scala code at Tendril as a developer.

  Wiremock
    I used Wiremock when I desired test coverage of my client API making and deserializing server responses.

  Mockito
    I've used Mockito and PowerMock to spice it up a bit.

  Finagle
    I used Finagle around inter-service calls on one application, but with the absence of stream processing, callback hell was endured, massively decreasing code readability, thereby maintainability.

  Google Protocol Buffers
    I used protobuf for inter-service communications on one project.

  Puppet
    I used Puppet at two companies and investigated at JDA.

  Zookeeper
    I used Zookeeper a couple of companies and investigated it for use with OSGi at JDA.

  Nagios
    I used Nagios to manage tens of hosts at Evolution Hosting.

  OSGi
    I designed and coded our first uses of it at JDA. Apache Karaf and Felix were our choices.

  CXF
    I prototyped CXF for use within OSGi at JDA.

  Objective-C (iOS)
    I was trained in iOS coding in Xcode and JetBrains' ReSharper at JDA as a developer.

  Android
    I trained myself on it and did a little prototyping of one iOS app I had written.

  Atlassian Tools
    I used most of Atlassian's tools at Tendril and JDA as well as their Intelli-J IDEA plugin with which pre-commit Crucible code review creation was facilitated.

  Grails
    I used grails to create an RDB, web CRUD prototype at JDA proving that SQL Server (relational) was faster than Neo4j (non-relational/nosql) for our generic system. Personally I also created a trading web site using Monet DB which enables users to post items with images and descriptions which they desired to trade. Users would matchup trades.

  JEE
    A decade ago I was trained in the precursors and in J2EE at Sun Microsystems and I designed systems for their customers using it while training their customers in it. I continued using it elsewhere, usually in JBoss, but also in WebLogic. I know of recent versions, but primarily have at work used Jetty and Tomcat alone, often reverse-proxied by Apache or Nginx.

  JBoss
    I have used JBoss professionally since version 2.x. Sun customers, Packexpo, Etilize, RedPrairie/JDA, and others using JMS/MoM, jBPM and merely as a finite state machine (FSM).

  Jetty, Tomcat
    I have used them at almost every employer, including JBoss Web, a variant of Tomcat/Catalina.

  Unix, Linux FreeBSD/Darwin/OS-X
    BeOS and GNU Operating System attempted to be completely asynchronous and concurrent, a noble goal, but found correctness and debugging overly daunting challenges. The winners to date remain traditionally programmed variants of Unix which continuously and steadily evolve over time reaching new platforms, accommodating new and changing hardware, and debugging and improving their own code.

    Obviously, I am a Unix guy including having worked at Sun, been a consultant representing Sun, coded in Linux in Operating Systems as an undergraduate, and studied system administration under Evi Nemeth (an originator of the "sudo" command, author of the Unix System Administration Handbook, among many other unique achievements) at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
